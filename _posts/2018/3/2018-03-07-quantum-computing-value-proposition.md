Let’s keep it like at that for now.&nbsp; Let’s focus on the consequences of that quantum model.</p><h2>Superposition means many states at once</h2><p>Quantum Computers operate on superposition of classical bits.&nbsp; This mean they operate on many classical states at once.</p><p>Let’s bring the big guns to illustrate this:&nbsp; Nicolas Cage.&nbsp; With his over the top acting and weird hairdo, he conveys the concept <em>radically</em>.</p><p>In the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_(2007_film)">Next</a>, Nicolas Cage’s character has one nifty super-power:&nbsp; he can see one or two minutes in the future.&nbsp; This allows him to explore the immediate future.&nbsp; Taking different decisions along the way, he can explore different scenarios.</p><p><br />
In the following clip, towards the end of the movie, his character is looking for a terrorist in a building.&nbsp; We see his character walking around.&nbsp; At each intersection, two versions of himself emerge, each exploring one path:</p><p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lufECeWtN34&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]
</p>
<p>A few seconds later we see the space filled with Nicolas Cage’s character.&nbsp; Each is arriving at the end of a possible path.&nbsp; One of them found the terrorist, so it appears as he found him in seconds.</p><p>Julian Moore also is in this movie.&nbsp; To add insult to injury, she’s kind of playing Cage’s sidekick.&nbsp; Life throws some curve balls at us.</p><p>But… this clip illustrates Quantum Computing very well! A Classical Computer would loop through different sequences of classical bits. A Quantum Computer takes <strong>all possible sequences</strong> and operates on them at once. In a similar fashion we saw a superposition of Nicolas Cage’s character's versions.</p><p></p><p>This explanation skips a lot of complexity (e.g. measurement). We'll come back to it in future articles.</p><p>Superposition is the key to Quantum Computers. Quantum Computers solve some complex problems in much fewer steps than Classical Computers. Typically blind searches, where many different combinations must be explored, work best.<br /></p>
<p>This can be drastic as it often changes the actual computation complexity.&nbsp; For large enough number of qubits a computation could go from billion of years to minutes.</p><p><a href="assets/2018/3/quantum-computing-value-proposition/pexels-photo-2101581.jpg"><img width="320" height="214" title="pexels-photo-210158" align="right" style="border:0 currentcolor;border-image:none;float:right;display:inline;background-image:none;" alt="pexels-photo-210158" src="assets/2018/3/quantum-computing-value-proposition/pexels-photo-210158_thumb1.jpg" border="0" /></a>That is the value proposition of Quantum Computing:&nbsp; solving today’s intractable problems.</p><p>We can easily imagine the disruption.&nbsp; What is today impossible is going to be possible tomorrow and easy the day after that.&nbsp; All disruptions start that way.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p><a href="assets/2018/3/quantum-computing-value-proposition/pexels-photo-461593.jpg"><img width="320" height="213" title="pexels-photo-461593" align="left" style="border:0 currentcolor;border-image:none;float:left;display:inline;background-image:none;" alt="pexels-photo-461593" src="assets/2018/3/quantum-computing-value-proposition/pexels-photo-461593_thumb.jpg" border="0" /></a>Let’s remember that there aren’t any large scale Quantum Computers in existence.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Quantum_Experience">IBM Quantum Experience</a> has a 20 qubits quantum computer.&nbsp; It’s an interesting toy but won’t solve real world problems we can’t solve with a Classic Computer.</p><p>There are still a lot of challenges to build a large scale quantum computer, i.e. one with thousands of qubits.&nbsp; It is unknown how stable those computers would be.&nbsp; Sensibility to noise tends to increase with the number of qubits.&nbsp; This would create inaccurate computations.</p><p>Quantum Computer is a big bet.&nbsp; Possibilities are vast while likelihood of high scale Quantum Computer is not certain.</p><p>The field is developing quickly though.&nbsp; Results are very promising.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>We have looked at the value proposition of Quantum Computing.</p><p>
Quantum Computers solve problems that are intractable (in time and/or memory) today.</p><p>If and when this happens, we should be up for a major disruption.</p><p>In future articles we will look at different aspects of Quantum Computing.&nbsp; Stay tuned.</p><p>Also see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Z-UUPjYY4">good introduction</a> from Microsoft Research, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWqs6S259Z4">deeper dive</a> &amp; an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3csr3fXBfo">overview of the journey</a>.</p>
