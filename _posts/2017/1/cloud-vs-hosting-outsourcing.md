The very contrary is the truth.</em>"</p> <p>What Jevons had put his finger on is that making a resource cheaper doesn’t imply that the total economic value of that resource goes down, but the contrary.&nbsp; It is quite easy to see with our modern eyes:&nbsp; if I could tomorrow make gasoline %90 cheaper for the foreseeable future, it is likely that we would start using gasoline more an more in areas where it is prohibitive today, not keep the consumption flat.</p> <p>So much for the “technological innovation will get us out of the energy crisis”.</p> <p>The same goes for the cloud and this is the business model disruption it brings to outsourcers hanging on their aging assets.</p> <p>This also explains why the cloud isn’t good for every workload on the face of the Earth.&nbsp; Some workload do benefit from customization an outsourcer / hosting environment can bring which aren’t available in the cloud (and in some case might never be).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now just to bring some nuance to the <em>standardization</em> motto I brought above:&nbsp; public cloud does evolve with customer feedback.&nbsp; In Azure, for instance, there are more and more VM skus, network configurations &amp; overall variety of services.&nbsp; But this isn’t the result of one customer asking for a customization but general feedback from multiple customers.</p>
