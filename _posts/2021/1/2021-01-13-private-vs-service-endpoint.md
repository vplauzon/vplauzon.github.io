What is the difference between [Service Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) and [Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) in Azure?

What are the advantage of one versus the other?

When should we use one versus the other?

For this article, I've done something a different.  I've created a video on YouTube.

I wanted to try a different medium to communicate.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, we all had to do a lot of video conferencing.  I personnally find it hard to absorb information by video conference.  On the other hand, I've spent countless hours watching YouTube video about other topics than IT.  So I forced to conclude that the way we present in video must be wrong.

So I gave myself the challenge to improve my presentation style.  I'm obviously open to feedback.  Let me know what you think!
