This is a short post to recommend a course available online.

Rather than a technical course, this is a class at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/):  [Advanced Database Systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/schedule.html).

The class is given by [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and covers all the internal of advance database systems, focussing on in-memory.

We are taken on a journey to study the concurrency controls, indexes, storage model, compression, networking, scheduling, query execution, compilation, vectorized execution, join algorithms, optimizer, server-side logic and new hardware.

I do not have the personal goal of writing the next big database but understand the internals of databases gave me a new depth on the topic and help me understand design choices of existing databases.  The course often shows alternatives taken by different commercial, open source & academic databases and the impact of the design decisions.

It was recommended to me by a colleague and I strongly recommend it to you if you want to gain a broader and deeper knowledge of database systems.
