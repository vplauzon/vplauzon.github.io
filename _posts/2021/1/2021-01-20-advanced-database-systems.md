This is a short post to recommend a course available online.

Rather than a technical course, this is a class at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/):  [Advanced Database Systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/schedule.html).

The class is given by [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and covers all the internal of advance database systems, focussing on in-memory.

We are taken on a journey to study:

* Concurrency controls
* Indexes
* Storage model
* Compression
* Networking
* Scheduling
* Query execution
* Compilation
* Vectorized execution
* Join algorithms
* Optimizer
* Server-side logic
* New hardware

I do not have the personal goal of writing the next big database but understand the internals of databases gave me a new depth on the topic and help me understand design choices of existing databases.  The course often shows alternatives taken by different commercial, open source & academic databases and the impact of the design decisions.

It was recommended to me by a colleague and I strongly recommend it to you if you want to gain a broader and deeper knowledge of database systems.

It is a uni course hence it's quite a bit of time investment even if we just listen without doing the project assignments (which looked pretty cool BTW).  I must have spent 40 hours on it.
