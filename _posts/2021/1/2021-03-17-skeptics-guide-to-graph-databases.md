I found a great talk about graph databases this week!

This one is from the [NDC{Oslo}](https://ndcoslo.com/) conference:  [A Skeptics Guide to Graph Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOYodfN84N4) by [David Bechberger](http://www.bechberger.com/) (author of [Graph Databases in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/graph-databases-in-action?a_aid=bechberger)).

The main "points" of the talk or the things to learn when watching it:

*   What are Graph Databases?
*   Which use cases are Graph Databases useful for?
*   Which use cases it doesn't perform well?
*   Since we can do everything with a relational database (status quo), what problems are better solved with a Graph Database?
*   How to determine if a problem would be a good fit for graph DB
*   A tour of the (very large & immature) landscape
*   Mistakes the speaker did
*   How to be successful

An interesting datapoint the speaker quoted from [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_categories) was the trending popularity of Graph DBs compared to other paradigms:

So, Graph databases are on the rise!

For those interested in graph theory (the mathematics behind graph databases, i.e. the fun part!), I recommend the book I went through last summer:  [Algorithmic graph theory and perfect graphs, 2nd edition](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL18211509M/Algorithmic_graph_theory_and_perfect_graphs) by [Martin Charles Golumbic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Charles_Golumbic).  It is available on [O'Reilly Learing](https://learning.oreilly.com/).



Enjoy!
