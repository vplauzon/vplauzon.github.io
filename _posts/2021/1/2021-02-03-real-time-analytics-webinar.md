I did a webinar titled [Real Time Analytics: Identify patterns and rapidly investigate root cause in your operational data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHOXw-k3raw) on January 13th, 2021.

In case you missed it, I posted it on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqemKkJpgwkQyvji9ZRrVg).  The official description was:

>>>Is your organization getting real time insights from the operational data? Rapid access to the telemetry data produced by these systems enables you to detect anomalies quickly and trigger actions to remedy. There is a new approach to consume, analyze and understand the immense volume of data generated by modern operational systems. Join this session to learn about Azure Data Explorer (ADX), and how Canadian customers leverage the solution for real-time decision making.
