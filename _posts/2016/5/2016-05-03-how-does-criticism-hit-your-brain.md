<p>Everybody loves a critic, right?&nbsp; How do you give feedback to somebody and be effective, i.e. without your message getting deflected on their “shield”?</p> <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/280px-wandsworth_shield1.png"><img title="280px-Wandsworth_Shield[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:left;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;border-left:0;margin:0 9px 0 0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="280px-Wandsworth_Shield[1]" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/280px-wandsworth_shield1_thumb.png" width="280" align="left" height="271"/></a></p> <p>An area I found especially hard to deliver constructive feedback is presentation / public speaking skills.&nbsp; Criticizing the way somebody speaks or organizes his / her thoughts often hits very close to home.</p> <p>My experience is that getting feedback on presentations I do is though too.&nbsp; Believe me:&nbsp; it’s not because of lack of material as I’m very far from perfection!&nbsp; Some people can’t articulate what you do wrong, most do not dare in fear of offending you.</p> <p>Last week I witnessed a colleague giving feedback on somebody’s presentation.&nbsp; I found him especially effective…&nbsp; but I didn’t quite understand why.&nbsp; He was positive and uplifting while still suggesting ways to improve.&nbsp; Beyond that I couldn’t see how I could replicate.&nbsp; The following day I read an article from <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com" target="_blank">Fast Company</a> discussing criticism that explained exactly what my colleague was doing right.&nbsp; So I thought I would share it here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3058834/why-sweetening-your-criticism-with-compliments-makes-everything-worse" target="_blank">Why Criticism Is So Tough To Swallow (And How To Make It Go Down Easier)</a> by Caroline Webb.</p> <h2>Form &amp; Content</h2> <p>There are two parts about delivering criticism:</p> <ul> <li>The form, which I’m going to discuss here</li> <li>The content:&nbsp; what do you see in somebody’s presentation that could be improved?</li></ul> <p>The second part requires experience in order to go beyond trivialities (e.g. <em>we couldn’t hear you</em>).&nbsp; Unless you have a job where you are presenting &amp; seeing colleagues present all the time, you won’t get experience quickly.&nbsp; If that’s your case, I would suggest joining public speaking clubs (e.g. <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/" target="_blank">Toastmasters</a>).</p> <h2>The Sandwich</h2> <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo1.jpg"><img title="pexels-photo[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="pexels-photo[1]" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo1_thumb.jpg" width="357" align="right" height="238"/></a></p> <p>The author mentions the good old <em>praise sandwich</em>.&nbsp; If you aren’t familiar with the meal, let me get you two introduced.</p> <p>Basically, it’s a ham sandwich where you replace the bread by praise and the ham by improvement suggestions (criticism).</p> <p>I’ve been handed my fair share of that sandwich and I did cook a few myself.</p> <p>Nothing could go wrong, right?&nbsp; You manage the feelings of the other person by throwing praises for intro &amp; conclusion, keeping the negative in the middle.</p> <p>It is actually a good way to structure feedback.&nbsp; The problem she points out is that many people keep the <strong>praise generic </strong>and the <strong>criticism specific</strong>.</p> <p>The example she gave hit me because I’ve done a very similar one recently:&nbsp; “your speech was great, I would do X differently, would improve Y this way and would consider doing Z, otherwise, fantastic speech!”</p> <p>Why is this so ineffective?</p> <h2>Criticisms = Threat</h2> <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo-684211.jpg"><img title="pexels-photo-68421[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:left;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="pexels-photo-68421[1]" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo-684211_thumb.jpg" width="240" align="left" height="160"/></a>Your ancestors were hunted by big animals.&nbsp; They survived.</p> <p>Why?&nbsp; Because they were very alert about threats around them.&nbsp; So alert that those threats were registering at an unconscious level, even when they were not looking for it.</p> <p>They passed their genes to you, so your brain is constantly on the lookout for threats.&nbsp; There are no wolves around anymore so it settles for other threats…&nbsp; like criticism.</p> <p>This is why we are very sensitive to criticism.&nbsp; Criticism, socially, is dangerous.</p> <p>By making criticism specific, a feedback raises the level of stress of the person you are delivering the feedback to.&nbsp; They become defensive.&nbsp; They stop listening.</p> <h2>Praises need to be concrete to be efficient</h2>  <p>We love praises.&nbsp; Praises are social rewards.&nbsp; That’s good.</p> <p>What we love even better is specific praises.</p> <p>Our brain responds better to concrete ideas than abstract ones, despite all the linear algebra we did in college.</p> <p>So when we say something like “you’re great but your vocabulary is repetitive”, the threat takes over the generic praise.</p> <h2>A better way to give feedback</h2> <p>So the better way the author suggests is:</p> <ul> <li>Give specific praises:&nbsp; give examples of what the person did well and expand on why you liked it.&nbsp; “I really liked the way you started with a joke, you paused to let people laugh, you smiled, so you connected with the crowd, then you kicked in the topic”.</li> <li>Build on the praises to suggest improvements:&nbsp; “What could make it even more effective is if you would transition between sections by taking a pause of few seconds to let the last section sink and allow people top breath and be ready for more”.</li></ul> <p>Basically, you amplify your praise and you downplay your criticism, but in form, not in content</p> <p>Actually, you don’t criticize, you suggest improvement on what’s already there.&nbsp; It isn’t political correctness like calling a massive layoff “right sizing”.&nbsp; The goal is different:&nbsp; you don’t underline what’s missing, you suggest what could be done to make the whole better.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>I really encourage you to read the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3058834/why-sweetening-your-criticism-with-compliments-makes-everything-worse" target="_blank">original article</a>.&nbsp; It is a good read.</p> <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo-661341.jpg"><img title="SAMSUNG CSC" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="SAMSUNG CSC" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pexels-photo-661341_thumb.jpg" width="240" align="right" height="160"/></a>Now, something I would add is to go easy on criticism.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that people change very slowly.&nbsp; So if you hit them with 8 criticisms, beside having them <em>crying in fetal position in their shower</em>, you won’t accomplish much.&nbsp; It’s a long term game.&nbsp; You give a few pointers at a time for them to improve a little at the time.</p> <p>I took a badminton class when I was at the university and one day the teacher came in with a video camera.&nbsp; He said something very wise, in the line of:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“A camera is a powerful tool to analyze the style of a player and it is used more and more in sports.&nbsp; You have to be careful though.&nbsp; A camera sees everything and you can destroy an athlete with it.”</em></p></blockquote> <p>When you look at somebody’s performance, be it a presentation or any kind of work that they do, <strong>you are the camera</strong>.&nbsp; Be lenient.</p> <p>But do give feedback.&nbsp; Because you likely see something the other person doesn’t see.&nbsp; Delivered appropriately, feedback is gift!</p>
