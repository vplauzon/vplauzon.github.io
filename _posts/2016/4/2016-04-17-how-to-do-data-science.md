These days, it’s all about Data Science.

What is Data Science?

Last month Brandon Rohrer, from the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning">Cortana Intelligence and Machine Learning Blog</a>, came up with an excellent post.

<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/03/28/how-to-do-data-science/" target="_blank">How to do Data Science</a>?

The post basically goes over the workflow I reproduced at the right here.

I found this article both <strong>complete</strong> and <strong>succinct</strong>:  a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">very good read</span>.

It goes through all the motions you need to go through while analysing data, from fixing an objective (asking a question), formatting the data to manipulating the data and finally throw that to some Machine Learning.

It is something of a badly kept secret that %95 of Machine Learning is <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx" target="_blank">Yak Shaving</a> around massaging data.  This is why I like the terminology <em>Data Science</em> because it does includes all the data manipulation you need to do to <em>feed the beast</em>.

So I strongly encourage you to read the post on <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/03/28/how-to-do-data-science/">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/03/28/how-to-do-data-science/</a>
