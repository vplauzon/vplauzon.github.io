<p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/medium1.png"><img title="Medium[1]" style="background-image:none;float:left;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:0 10px 0 0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" border="0" alt="Medium[1]" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/medium1_thumb.png" width="90" align="left" height="90"/></a>Back in <a href="https://vincentlauzon.com/2010/08/04/event-bus-in-windows-azure/">summer 2010</a> I called for a notification mechanism within Azure, something that would call customer-defined code to take action when something happen within your subscription, e.g. a file added to blob storage, a message added to a queue, etc.&nbsp; .</p> <p>Back then I called it an <em>Event Bus</em>, because buses were cool in 2010.</p> <p>Finally, I got what I wanted in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/" target="_blank">Azure Functions</a>!</p> <h2>What it is</h2> <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/image_thumb2.png" width="83" align="right" height="240"/></a>Azure Functions is a piece of code which executes when a trigger (timer, web hook, queue message, etc.) kicks in.</p> <p>We can see Azure Functions as a micro-execution engine, or micro-compute on demand.</p> <p>But really, <em>an Azure Function is the Cloud equivalent to a C# event handler</em>.&nbsp; This is pretty powerful.</p> <p>The model also includes Inputs &amp; Outputs.&nbsp; This integrates into the function code.&nbsp; For instance, in C# inputs are passed as input parameter to the function.</p> <p>You can hook the function to source control to quickly deploy new versions.</p> <h2>What it brings to the table</h2> <p>Why is this interesting?&nbsp; Can’t you do that today by having a Web Job (or even a Worker Role) monitoring queues, blob storage and all?</p> <p>Yes, you can.&nbsp; In that sense, Azure Function doesn’t bring new capabilities, it facilitates it.</p> <p>Instead of having a Web Job containing many handlers for disparate tasks, you have a lightweight, script-like component that react to one trigger.</p> <p>Azure Functions really are an evolution of Web Jobs.&nbsp; They use the same SDK, hook to the same triggers and…&nbsp; run in the same compute:&nbsp; <em>App Service</em>.</p> <p>Another great things about Azure Functions is that it comes with the possibility of using a <em>Dynamic</em> App Service Plan.&nbsp; With a Dynamic plan, you pay only for the compute milliseconds (up to 100ms) you use as oppose to standing up instances waiting for triggers to fire.&nbsp; This brings a lot of cost agility to the table, although 10 instances still is the upper limit if many instances are required to run many functions at the same time.</p> <h2>Where to find more</h2> <p>As usual, I recommend the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/functions/" target="_blank">official documentation</a>, more specifically, start with the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-overview/" target="_blank">overview</a> and work your way down.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p>Azure functions bring a new way to create cloud event handlers.&nbsp; It enables elastic computing by having those scripts running only when triggers are activated.</p>
