I had the pleasure to present an introduction to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to a customer crowd yesterday.

A big part of the presentation was a demo of basic functionalities where I went through the creation of pods, deployments, services &amp; looked at monitoring.

The demo is on <a href="https://github.com/vplauzon/azure-training/tree/master/aks-intro">GitHub here</a>.

I thought I would share that as it can help others to demo that great service.

Enjoy!
