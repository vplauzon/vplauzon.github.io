<p>Back in December (2011), Microsoft released the Azure Service Bus EAI &amp; EDI Labs.&#160; This is a sort of CTP with labs.</p>  <p>It’s built on top of AppFabric Service Bus, but seems to contain much more than raw messaging.</p>  <p>According to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh689864.aspx">MSDN documentation</a>, it seems that a lot of BizTalk concepts were re-used.&#160; For instance, look at a ‘transform project’:</p>  <p><img title="Transforms Project Design Surface" alt="Transforms Project Design Surface" src="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC553343.gif" width="640" height="442" /></p>  <p>If you see a familiarity with the Mapping tool of BizTalk, you’re not alone!</p>  <p>I haven’t have time to really look at this new piece of technology.&#160; I just hope it won’t have the same curse than BizTalk, for instance making a simple scenario extremely complicated and being a deployment &amp; monitoring hassle.</p>
