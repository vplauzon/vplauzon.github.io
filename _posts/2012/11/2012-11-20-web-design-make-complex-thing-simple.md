<p>I’m always amazed at you a simple user interface can simplify complex tasks.</p>  <p>Take Windows Explorer where you can drag &amp; drop multiple files from one folder to another.&#160; The user sees which folders the files are going into, it takes a few seconds and boom!&#160; Doing that by command line would be much more abstract, left alone much more verbose.</p>  <p>Well, here’s an interesting article about web design and how the English government manage to migrate 750 web sites into one well designed gateway.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121106224406-10842349-the-uk-government-shows-how-to-design-for-simplicity"><img alt="" src="http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/6/000/1c0/3a1/03d2b05.png" /></a></p>  <p>I wish we could have that in Canada.&#160; Last time I did consultancy for the Federal Government of Canada, we were still arguing about a single-sign-on solution adopted by less than %50 of the government sites.&#160; Each department have their own server, often their own Active Directory, that do not see each other.&#160; We are quite at a distance from a one-portal solution!</p>
