<p>As other news about Azure spring 2012 roadmap are <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-cloud-roadmap-for-2012-whats-on-tap/11522">getting public</a>, I am now at liberty of discussing them.</p>  <p>Here are the highlights:</p>  <ul>   <li>As I discussed in a <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/iaas-coming-to-windows-azure/">previous blog</a>, Windows Azure will support Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), i.e. stateful VM roles. </li>    <li>     <div align="left">%99.9 availability for single instances ; this is interesting since so far we had to have at least two instances of a service to get the %99.9 SLA.&#160; This is very likely related to the new ability of Azure to transfer VM state from one server to another (see previous item)</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">UDP support!&#160; Weâ€™ve noticed a <a href="http://www.mygreatwindowsazureidea.com/forums/34192-windows-azure-feature-voting/suggestions/400782-udp-endpoints?ref=title">high demand for this feature</a> and the lack of support was a show stopper for gaming platforms.</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">File shipping via Hard Drives, especially useful for Media customers who previously had to upload their terabyte of movies</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Better on-premise Active Directory support ; I do not know if this is through Azure Connect (IPSec VPN tunnelling through Azure) or Azure AppFabric Access Control with ADFS or something entirely new.</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">SQL Azure Reporting Services, in <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-sql-azure-reporting/">CTP for a while</a>, Azure-side report processing, same tooling than on-premise</div>   </li> </ul> So Azure continues its maturing process, getting more and more features and hence enabling more and more scenarios.
