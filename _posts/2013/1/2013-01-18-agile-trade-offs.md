<p>It was very refreshing to read <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Paul-Dolman%7EDarrall">Paul Dolman-Darrall</a>’s article about the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tradeoff_certainty">trade-offs to adopt in an agile delivery model</a>.</p>  <p>Agile is more than 10 years old but still have whimsical attributes of a brand new artefact.&#160; I believe this isn’t unique to agile but tend to be the case for any delivery methodology.&#160; It seems that however how long a methodology has been around, only a limited set of characteristics is remembered, barely understood and cited <em>ad nauseam</em>.</p>  <p>PMI?&#160; Large project plan, rigid schedule.</p>  <p>Agile?&#160; Stand up meetings, open bar (no scope keeping).</p>  <p>RUP?&#160; Lots of deliverables, configurable.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Now Paul’s article dived beneath the surface, exploring different ways to use an agile methodology depending on what we want to optimize.&#160; His analogy with athletes, body type and training is quite good:&#160; e.g. a sprinter doesn’t train the same way as an ultra-marathoner, although both might be world-class athlete.&#160; Also, trade-offs are part of success recipes:&#160; no athlete can excel in both long &amp; short distance.</p>  <p>This graph of his is especially good at expressing the idea of trade-offs in delivery:</p>  <p><a href="/assets/2013/1/agile-trade-offs/6fig1.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="6fig1" border="0" alt="6fig1" src="/assets/2013/1/agile-trade-offs/6fig1_thumb.jpg" width="529" height="365" /></a></p>  <p>What do you need to optimize in your project?</p>  <p>I encourage you to read <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tradeoff_certainty">Paul’s article</a>.</p>
