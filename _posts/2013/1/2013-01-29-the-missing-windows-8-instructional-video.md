<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> has produced an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BSmmSU-UZU">high quality video on YouTube</a>.</p>  <p>The video is a nice and comprehensive introduction to Windows 8 for everyone (i.e. not geek only).</p>  <p>My experience with Windows 8 is that once you’ve figured out a few things (e.g. how to activate contextual Search), you can start appreciating the product.&#160; Before that, it just looks and feels weird and annoying.</p>  <p>I’ve learned the ropes by myself and through all the blogs I’m reading.&#160; But something tells me my wife won’t have that patience.&#160; I’ll try that video on her!</p>
