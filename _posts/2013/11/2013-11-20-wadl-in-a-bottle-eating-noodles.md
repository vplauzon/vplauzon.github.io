In <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/rest-style-with-hypermedia-apis/">my last entry</a> about REST web services I talked about its biggest weakness for me: the lack of description model of REST services.

The idea of hitting an HTTP endpoint as a shot in the dark is for me quite a leap of faith, and very likely an invitation to spend hours troubleshooting.

But despair no more, enters <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/">WADL</a>! If it sounds like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a>, it's because it's essentially the same acronym:

<em>Web <strong>Service Definition</strong> Language</em> -&gt; WSDL

<em>Web <strong>Application Description</strong> Language</em> -&gt; WADL

So WADL aims to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WSDL of REST</a>.

But… it was submitted the W3C in December 2009 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystem</a>… one month before it was acquired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>. Since them, it hasn't budged… coincidence?

No other parties seem to have backed it, so it seems deemed to join the junkyard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPR">unilateral attempt at standardizing global assets</a>!

You can look up at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">an example on Wikipedia</a>.

Maybe we'll have another standard one day. Or maybe it's a non-issue and I'm the only one to worry about it.
