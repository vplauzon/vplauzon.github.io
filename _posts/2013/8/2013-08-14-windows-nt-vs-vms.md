<p>Very interesting article from <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/">Mark Russinovich</a> dating from Decembre 1998:</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://windowsitpro.com/windows-client/windows-nt-and-vms-rest-story">Windows NT and VMS: The Rest of the Story</a></p>  <p>Russinovich explains how David Cutler lead Windows NT after leaving digital and how he and his team borrow from their work on VAX machines.</p>  <p>The article goes on explaining the similarities between Windows NT &amp; VMS (OS of VAX) and by doing so goes into some of the low level details of Windows NT with Russinovichâ€™s talent to explain complex systems in few lines.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>A must read!</p>
