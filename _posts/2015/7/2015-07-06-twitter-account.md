I finally gave in and I created <a href="https://twitter.com/vplauzon">my own Twitter account</a>.

<img style="float:left;margin-left:0;display:inline;margin-right:0;" src="/assets/2015/7/twitter-account/twitter-312464_6401.png" alt="" width="240" height="195" align="left" />Several reasons have motivated my decision:
<ul>
	<li>Reaching a different audience</li>
	<li>Being able to more easily follow other Twitters</li>
	<li>Not be the only techie without a Twitter account :P</li>
</ul>
It will also allow me to publish more stuff with much less details than on my blog (e.g. shooting a URL of an interesting article) and broaden the topics (e.g. you might see jogging stuff in there).

See there!
