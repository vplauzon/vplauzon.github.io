<p>I found this very informative <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/12/how-to-build-habit-forming-products/">introduction article</a> on how addiction works in products such as Facebook or Candycrush on <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>.
</p><p>I've been exposed to the concepts in the recent years thanks to a friend of mine who became an expert on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a>.  It turns out that the mechanics used to get you hooks on different video games were extracted and are now used to get you hooked on different products.
