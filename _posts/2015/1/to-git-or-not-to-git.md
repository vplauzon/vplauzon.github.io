<p>GIT, the one that vanquish them all.  Gee…  I can't get my head around that product!
</p><p>I spent an entire 5 months project using it and I still don't get it.  True, I used it with the proverbial 10 feet pole, with the minimal subset of features and with no integration into Visual Studio (thanks to a weird Network setup of the project).
</p><p>Anyway…  since then I keep wearing my paper bag on my head when people talk about GIT eloquently.  But soon, I won't.  <a href="http://customdesigntools.com/author/jacob-gube/">Jacob Gube</a> has published <a href="http://customdesigntools.com/interactive-git-tutorials/">a post with not one but three ways to learn GIT</a>.
</p><p>So if you are like me, a social renegade because of your ignorance, consult that post and together we might emerge from the darkness that has been our lives for the last couple of years <span style="font-family:Wingdings;">J</span></p>
