I’ve contributed an entry-level article on code project about the Open Data Protocal (OData).

I go through the basics of the protocol, how it is structured, how to consume it and where I see usage.

I did this in order to follow suit with an article on ADO.NET around OData and I didn’t have anything to point at for foundation!
