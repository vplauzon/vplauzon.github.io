<p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://avanimation.avsupport.com/files/backgrnd/Cloud-11.jpg" width="400" height="299" />I finally read an <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2010/07/12/next-generation-bpos.aspx">official note</a> from the BPOS team about a bunch of features I was looking for in BPOS, especially for SharePoint.&#160; Mainly:</p>  <ul>   <li>Federated Identity!</li>    <li>SharePoint 2010 Online</li>    <li>Extranet access for SharePoint online</li> </ul>  <p>There are no date mentioned, but BPOS usually deploys new version quarterly.</p>  <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/microsoft-online-bpos/">past blog</a>, the federated identity (or single sign-on) was the major show stopper for my company, so with this out of the way, the offering becomes <strong>much more</strong> interesting.</p>
