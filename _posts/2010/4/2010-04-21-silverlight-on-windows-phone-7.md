<p></p>  <p>I just read a nice article from Scott Gu’s Blog:&#160; <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/03/18/building-a-windows-phone-7-twitter-application-using-silverlight.aspx">Building a Windows Phone 7 Twitter Application using Silverlight</a>.</p>  <p>Scott builds two samples mini-apps (an Hello World and a simple Twitter Client).&#160; The integration with Visual Studio Designer seems to be quite good, you even see the phone while you’re designing!&#160; You still have the entire .NET to harness, including WCF, Silverlight, events, multi-threading, etc.&#160; .</p>  <p>This definitely beats iPhone development any day!</p>
