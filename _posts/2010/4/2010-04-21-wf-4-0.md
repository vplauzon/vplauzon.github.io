<p>After toying with Microsoft Virtual Labs (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/aa570323(en-us).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/aa570323(en-us).aspx</a>) on Workflow Foundation (WF) in .NET Framework 4.0, I must say I’m pretty impressed. </p>  <p>Coupled with Windows Server AppFabric (formally known as Dublin Server), it’s basically BizTalk Server without all the schemas and adapters coming out-of-the-box with BizTalk.&#160; Otherwise, it’s as powerful and actually much easier to use. </p>  <p>The integration of WCF &amp; WF, so half-ass in .NET 3.5 SP1, is quite well done.&#160; You create a Workflow, drop a few Send / Receive activities around and that creates an implicit WCF endpoint with an implicit WCF contract.&#160; Quite gorgeous!</p>
