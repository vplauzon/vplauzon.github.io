<p><img src="http://www.msftkitchen.com/img/windows-8.png" />Stephen Chapman, from <a href="http://msftkitchen.com">Microsoft Kitchen</a>, dug up some Microsoft <a href="http://msftkitchen.com/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-numerous-details-revealed.html">leaked slides about Windows 8</a>.</p>  <p>Of course, it is early, it is unofficial, it’s only one notch above gossip, but we’re curious!&#160; So what’s in it?</p>  <p>You can read the article, but I’ll pick up those points:</p>  <ul>   <li>A great interest in Apple recent success (e.g. brand management, Apple Store) </li>    <li>Windows Store:&#160; You purchase software there and it follows you on your different devices (<a href="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Windows-Store-07.png"><img src="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Windows-Store-07.png" width="167" height="93" /></a>).&#160; Do they plan to leverage Live Mesh, Grid Soft and the rest? </li>    <li>Face recognition for login.&#160; Will it be mainstream or will do like voice recognition in Windows 7 (IMO, a nice gadget to show off to your friends but something you don’t really use) </li>    <li>Slate is an explicit form factor (<a href="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Differentiation-Goals-03.png"><img src="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Differentiation-Goals-03.png" width="151" height="92" /></a>) </li>    <li>Fast start-up (a log-off + hibernate cheap trick)</li>    <li>A Windows Reset that would be effectively re-installing Windows but keeping User Data (<a href="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Push-Button-Reset-01.png"><img src="http://msftkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Windows-8-Push-Button-Reset-01.png" width="171" height="95" /></a>)</li> </ul>  <p>As I said, very early, but interesting.</p>  <p>And again…&#160; Windows 8 won’t be based on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/">Singularity</a> if we trust those slides!</p>
