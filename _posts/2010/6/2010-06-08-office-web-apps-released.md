<p>Available at <a href="http://office.live.com">http://office.live.com</a>.</p>  <p>Basically, you need to use your sky drive as store.</p>  <p>I haven’t tried the integration with Office 2010, where you’re supposed to be able to share documents with other people and see them editing.&#160; I only have Office 2007 at work.&#160; With Office 2007, the file is locked altogether when you open it on your PC.</p>  <p>Now what we really need is an integration between Sky Drive &amp; Live Mesh so that I can simply edit on one of my PC folder and have it being replicated to the cloud.</p>  <p>Pretty cool web apps nevertheless.</p>
