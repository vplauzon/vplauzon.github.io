<p>Microsoft is starting to release <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/kinect/">commercial material</a> about its famous <em>Project Code Name Natal</em>.&#160; The brand name is <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/kinect/">Kinect</a>.</p>  <p>I do not know how close they actually came from their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qlHoxPioM">original vision</a>, given the time constraints (basically, it had to be shipped for XMas 2010).&#160; Spoken commands seems to be there, I don’t know about hi-res camera system…&#160; I reckon that if it delivers %75 of the original vision, it will be a blast!</p>  <p>You can have a look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2r9cKjNQe4">E3 first look</a>.</p>  <p>According to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Natal">Wikipedia</a> page, there are quite a few games targeting it.</p>
