<p>Ah, this is a tough question!</p>  <p>As <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/pdc-2010-keynotes/">I mentioned yesterday</a>, I was in Microsoft Office in Montreal for the PDC keynote diffusion after which there was a discussion about the keynote.</p>  <p>The room was filled mainly with freelancers and small company consultants (that is quite typical for a Montreal crowd actually).&#160; More than half of those individuals are Microsoft MVP, which was quite an impressive concentration.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.in3d.eu/in3d_2D_Images/HTML_Logo.jpg" width="180" height="135" />The most heated part of the discussion was about Microsoft message around the HTML 5 vs Silverlight.&#160; Steve Balmer’s message about Silverlight was…&#160; well there was no message, he didn’t explicitly talk about it.&#160; Of course, he talked a lot about Windows Phone 7 development, which has to be done in Silverlight, but he didn’t mention the ‘S’ word ;)</p>  <p>What he did talk about though was HTML 5.&#160; As I <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/pdc-2010-keynotes/">mentioned yesterday</a>, that was one of his key messages:&#160; Internet Explorer 9 / HTML 5.&#160; That was touted as the “glue between the client and the server”.&#160; If you read between the lines, you may interpret that Microsoft is now putting its weight behind HTML 5 instead of Silverlight.&#160; If you can read between the lines, you can read it <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834">in-the-lines of Bob Muglia</a>, Microsoft President in charge of server and tools business.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://martharotter.net/Sl_v_rgb_r.png" width="180" height="201" />This didn’t escape many of the people in the room.&#160; One of them actually made himself a Silverllight expert and basically just learned that he was old news.&#160; As he said, the problem with Silverlight is that once you’ve tried it, you don’t want to go back to java script!</p>  <p>It’s funny, because another person in the room got the same uneasy feeling when we talked about TFS in Azure.&#160; That person is an expert in TFS infrastructure and he just learned…&#160; he was old news.&#160; Both of those are MVPs, so I guess they felt betrayed on many levels.</p>  <p>But above betrayals, if you’re cutting edge today, where should you go?&#160; And where should you advise people to go?</p>  <p>Well…&#160; the thing is, I believe the question is still open.</p>  <p>Silverlight is much more mature than HTML 5 (which is far from %100 the same on every browser today) and much more complete for rich client application.&#160; The demos of HTML 5 flying toasters are quite impressive, but I’m not sure you would like to see a complex application written in javascript / HTML 5 canvas.&#160; Silverlight runs the same on every platform it supports (which is way fewer than where HTML 5 is supported or will be supported within a year).&#160; The programming model is way cleaner, you can separate assemblies, go with a rich class model, etc.&#160; .</p>  <p>That said, HTML 5 is offering quite a good share of what Silverlight is able to offer to the end-user.&#160; The coverage is way broader.&#160; But the developer experience is quite something else.&#160; Hence the complaints in the room.</p>  <p>Now I can see where Microsoft is coming from.&#160; They tied Internet Explorer 9 to the OS (it runs only on Windows Vista and more recent OS) in order to leverage the capacity to use hardware acceleration.&#160; That makes IE9 the fastest OS rendering and animating HTML-5.&#160; The competition will have trouble to follow them, especially that most of them (e.g. Chrome, Fire Fox) are available on many platforms.&#160; So they basically threw a curve at the competition.</p>  <p>A problem with this is that HTML 5 will be standard but the speed won’t.&#160; So you’re back to square one:&#160; do you want to develop rich application on a platform where the performance highly depends on the browser?</p>  <p>I think the dice have been thrown, but they’re still rolling on the table.&#160; For interactive-UI app, Flash &amp; Silverlight will be the way to go for quite a while.&#160; But for simpler UI (ie %90 of what you interact with everyday), HTML is back in the game with HTML 5.</p>  <p>A lot of arguments in the room were around the fact that a lot of companies still have IE 6 on their desktop.&#160; Well, cutting-edge client computing isn’t happening on your corporate desktop, isn’t it?&#160; The winner of the cutting-edge competition today will end-up on your corporate desktop.&#160; Microsoft has two horses in the race, hedging their bet.</p>
