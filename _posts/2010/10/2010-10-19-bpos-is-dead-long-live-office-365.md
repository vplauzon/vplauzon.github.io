<p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;border-width:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/image.png" width="222" height="68" /> Starting in early 2010, what was previously known as BPOS version 2 or <em>Union</em> will be available as <a href="http://community.office365.com/enus/office365/b/microsoft_office_365_blog/archive/2010/10/18/hello-office-365.aspx">Office 365</a>.&#160; The name should reflect the availability of the platform (which suffered <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2010/09/08/meeting-your-and-our-own-expectations.aspx">some reputation step back</a> this summer).&#160; Today the beta is released, available to a 1000+ customers worldwide.</p>  <p>Among the features of the new versions will be partial feature sets of the following on-premise products:</p>  <ul>   <li>Exchange Server 2010 SP1 </li>    <li>SharePoint 2010 </li>    <li>Lync Server 2010 </li>    <li>Federated Identity </li>    <li>Dynamics CRM </li> </ul>  <p>Another interesting aspect of the new offering will be its declinations, ie enterprise, mid-size business, education, etc.&#160; .&#160; With those new features, we can see the offering being more mature.&#160; They get more competitive for small user-base and more enterprise-ready for bigger customer.</p>  <p>As I wrote here <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/microsoft-online-bpos/">before</a>, I have been quite impressed with BPOS.&#160; The major hurdle for me was the absence of an enterprise single sign-on solution.&#160; This is going away with Office 365.&#160; This makes this offering very attractive.&#160; For instance, even for short-lived collaboration project SharePoint Online becomes a very good solution.</p>  <p>You can see a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Office-365-The-power-to-think-big-and-be-small-to-be-big-and-act-fast">demo</a> on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>.</p> Thanks to Mary-Jo Foley to spread the news (<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-christens-its-cloud-business-suite-as-office-365-launches-beta/7712">here</a> and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-christens-its-cloud-business-suite-as-office-365-launches-beta/7712">here</a>).
