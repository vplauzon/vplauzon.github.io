<p>Today was the first day of the PDC 2010.&#160; Microsoft hosts events all around the world, inviting local partners, where they broadcast the PDC keynotes and have a discussion around that afterwards.&#160; I was in such an event in Montreal.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="Cloud, Device Opportunities Outlined at Professional Developers Conference" alt="Cloud, Device Opportunities Outlined at Professional Developers Conference" align="right" src="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/_resources/images/homepage/2010/hero/event_pdc10postkeynote_hero.jpg" />Steve Ballmer was delivering the keynotes with many Microsoft stars delivering portions and demos (e.g. Scott Gu, Don Box, Mark Russinovich, etc.).&#160; Steve looked a bit less over-the-top energetic today.&#160; Is it the stock going down, his chief architect leaving?&#160; He didn’t tell…</p>  <p>There were three main themes:</p>  <ul>   <li>IE 9 / HTML 5 </li>    <li>Windows Phone 7 </li>    <li>Windows Azure </li> </ul>  <p>There wasn’t much news in the first two items.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/Internet-Explorer-9-IE9-Early-Preview-Demo-2.jpg" width="120" height="120" />IE 9 is great, fast and supports HTML 5.&#160; We got some crisps demos about how to integrate a site with Windows 7, via branded pinned-down-to-the-task-bar icons, branded (actually, coloured) back/forward buttons, customized jump list and even customized buttons (like the play / stop / rewind buttons you get on the preview of Windows Media Player).&#160; We even got the mandatory “look at this sample site, IE 9 is way faster than Google Chrome”, but they refrained from doing it on every demo.</p>  <p>The message there was that HTML 5 was the glue on all the MS experiences:&#160; XBox, Windows Phone 7, PC, etc. .&#160; That got some eyebrows raised in the assistance where a couple of consultants gambled their short-term career on Silverlight and led to some interesting discussions afterwards.</p>  <p>For the Windows Phone 7, I really didn’t learn much despite not going utterly out-of-my-way<img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/windows-phone-7-smartphone.jpg" width="250" height="196" /> to gather information usually (as I do for Windows Azure or parallel computing for instance).&#160; Scott Gu gave a good demo, sporting his typical red shirt.&#160; Beside OData library for WP7 being released today, the real news was the profiler for WP7.&#160; That’s a pretty good beast actually:&#160; it’s able to profile a run of an app, counting the frame per second, CPU utilization, # of objects being instantiated on the screen, etc.&#160; and alerting you when abnormal numbers show up.&#160; It seems like a very good piece of technology.&#160; It should be in beta soon.</p>  <p>The device looks very cool.&#160; I don’t know if it’s just the amount of effort put in the demo, but it really looks cool.&#160; Actually, an enterprise customer in the room with us told us they had access to a few devices during a development project of an app for his company and he really enjoyed the device.&#160; That customer later did an interesting presentation on Windows Azure (<a title="http://www.yellowapi.com/" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">http://www.yellowapi.com/</a>).</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.deviantart.com/download/143907838/Windows_Azure_by_PacMani.jpg" width="200" height="125" />Now the real darling of this show was Windows Azure.&#160; There I finally learned something and there was a bunch of announcements.&#160; Actually, Microsoft is doing two things.</p>  <p>First, they provided features answering to <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/08/26/windows-azure-customer-feedback/">feedbacks they got from customers</a>.&#160; Among the announcements:&#160; Extra-small cheaper instance, capacity to RDP on your server to better diagnose problems, full-IIS mode (allowing you to deploy more than one web sites in an instance among other things), a caching service (the equivalent to AppFabric or Velocity on-premise) and Reporting Services in the cloud.&#160; Those are all features requested by users and they will strengthen the offering.</p>  <p>Second they basically broaden the spectrum of there offer.&#160; VM role is #1 there:&#160; with this they basically get into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and compete directly with Amazon (will they be competitive on the price, that is an open question though).&#160; This feature should be available in beta by the end of the year.&#160; Server Application Virtualization…&#160; this is supposed to be the equivalent of App-V on the server side, in the cloud, but didn’t get demoed.&#160; With Network connection, you’ll be able to virtually extend your on-premise network (and domain) to Windows Azure.&#160; TFS in the cloud is…&#160; TFS in the cloud!&#160; It seems to include the source control, work items and even build server (via the VM Role or a worker role for standard environments) but not the SharePoint part nor the cubes.&#160; Azure App Fabric Service bus got some new bells and whistle (something <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/event-bus-in-windows-azure/">I certainly advocated for</a>), such as durable messaging, but none were demoed.&#160; Finally, a new Market-Place for Azure Services, a bit like Windows Phone Market place, but in the cloud (Project Dallas would become the data market, a sub product of that offer).</p>  <p><strong>-------------------------</strong></p>  <p><strong>ERATUM:&#160; VM role aren’t IaaS.&#160; This was a mistake from my part.&#160; Please read <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/vm-roles-arent-iaas/">this article</a> to understand why.</strong></p>  <p><strong>-------------------------</strong></p>  <p>There wasn’t much timeline given for those features except ‘later this year’.&#160; Nevertheless, those announcements give us the picture:&#160; Windows Azure is getting mature very quickly.&#160; The basis is getting stronger and larger.</p>  <p>Soon you’ll be able to take an on-premise .vhd of Windows Server 2008 R2 and move it to the cloud without much ceremony.&#160; This gives an excellent migration path for all the apps that would be too costly to modify.&#160; Basically, Windows Azure the <strong>Consolidate</strong>, <strong>Virtualize</strong>, <strong>Cloud</strong> roadmap suggested by the Gartner’s of this world.</p>  <p>I’ll tell you about the local discussion in a later post.</p>
