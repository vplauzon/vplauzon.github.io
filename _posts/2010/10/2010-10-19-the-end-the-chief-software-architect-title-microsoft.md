<p>Ray Ozzy is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/oct10/10-18steveb-mail.mspx">stepping down</a> the Chief Software Architect role at Microsoft.</p>  <p>He’s going to leave Microsoft in the short future.</p>  <p>Steve Balmer isn’t naming a new Chief Software Architect for the moment.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.bestpicturegallery.com/best-picture-gallery-weather-Chicago-lightning-storm-discopalace.jpg"><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://www.bestpicturegallery.com/best-picture-gallery-weather-Chicago-lightning-storm-discopalace.jpg" width="350" height="238" /></a>Since Bill Gates left Microsoft, the company has been running from one re-org to the other.&#160; For instance, earlier in October 2010, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/oct10/10-01Stevebmail.mspx">two new divisions were created</a> with a new president each.&#160; In the recent months, quite a few president and vice-president have been leave the corporation.&#160; For instance, Stephen Elop, formally MS Business Division’s president <a href="http://www.nokia.com/press/press-releases/showpressrelease?newsid=1443731">left for Nokia</a> on September 2010.</p>  <p>It seems it is becoming increasingly challenging to navigate such a big enterprise as Microsoft has become.&#160; Some think Microsoft is engaged in a down spiral, some think it is a necessary transformation.&#160; I tend to be in the second camp.</p>  <p>The market has changed dramatically since the 1990’s.&#160; Players have changed a lot.&#160; In the early 2000’s, we talked about Sun, BAE, Borland, Lycos, etc.&#160; .&#160; Google was a tiny player.&#160; Facebook, Twitter &amp; YouTube (later acquired by Google) didn’t exist.&#160; The internet wave <strong>is</strong> quite disruptive.&#160; Actually, I find it impressive for Microsoft to stay relevant after so long.</p>  <p>I still find that Microsoft is bringing a lot of good technologies on the table.&#160; Windows Azure has a very bright potential, SharePoint is a leader in the collaboration portal space, the .NET eco-system (including Visual Studio, TFS, Windows Server App Fabric, Silverlight, etc. ) really is top notch, their multi-core concurrency Fx &amp; tools really hit the target, Xbox Kinect is sold-out on pre-orders, Windows Phone 7 seems poised to be a good iPhone / Blackberry competitor, etc.&#160; .</p>  <p>Of course for all those positives, you can find a nice list of flops (let’s just mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin">three months fad Kin</a>), but as long as they can re-invent themselves, they will strive.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I still wonder what happened with Ray Ozzie.&#160; Filling the shoes of founder Bill Gates might have been too big an order.&#160; He did bring the whole Software + Service paradigm shift inside the company, championed Live Mesh &amp; pushed for Windows Azure.&#160; In the mean time, his <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/bb308957.aspx">Groove</a> got on the ice, looking more and more like a SharePoint client.&#160; It seems like he phased out the minute took the role couple of years ago.&#160; The man had plenty of vision and intellect.&#160; Apparently it’s quite hard to push that through at the moment.</p>  <p>Does Microsoft needs a super star at its head in order to work, like Apple’s Steve Jobs?&#160; I don’t think so.&#160; They have quite a battalion of smart leaders.&#160; The company is still learning to find its balance but it doesn’t lack smart people.&#160; If the leadership manage to get all that intellect to work towards common goal, they won’t need a messiah at their head!</p>  <p>In the mean time, you can follow Ray Ozzie on his <a href="http://ozzie.net/">new blog</a>.</p>  <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/ray-ozzie-hangs-up-his-chief-software-architect-hat/7703">Mary-Jo Foley</a> for spreading the news.</p>
