<p>Here’s an MSDN article about how to integrate WIF into an ASP.NET application:&#160; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/magazine/ff872350.aspx">Passive Authentication for ASP.NET with WIF</a>.</p>  <p>It doesn’t talk about ADFS it goes into the details of the configuration of WIF.&#160; That’s very interesting since the STS Wizard generates a bunch of configuration but no explanation on what is doing what.</p>
