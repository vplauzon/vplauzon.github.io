<p>I finally got an answer about the different environments in Windows Azure on the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Cloud+Cover/Cloud-Cover-Episode-21-Your-Questions-Answered/">Cloud Cover Channel 9 show</a>.&#160; Apparently my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Lanzoni">Fabio</a> Avatar was quite popular and helped to be selected!</p>  <p>I thought I would blog out their nuggets of wisdom as they are quite good guidance and I haven’t seen it anywhere on the web.</p>  <p><a href="assets/2010/8/dev-staging-production-in-windows-azure/environment1.jpg"><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;border-width:0;" title="environment[1]" border="0" alt="environment[1]" align="right" src="assets/2010/8/dev-staging-production-in-windows-azure/environment1_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="241" /></a> Basically, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Cloud+Cover/Cloud-Cover-Episode-18-ASPNET-Providers/?CommentID=560999">my question</a> was around managing configurations between dev, staging &amp; production environments.&#160; For instance, if you’re pointing to an Azure storage account or an SQL Azure instance, you’ll probably want to have different data in dev, staging &amp; production.</p>  <p>Well, the guidance is twofold.</p>  <h1></h1>  <h1></h1>  <h3>1- Use configuration settings</h3>  <p>Using the configuration settings within the Visual Studio Azure Service project is the way to control you configuration that will change from one environment to the other.</p>  <p>Why?</p>  <p>Because those configuration <strong>can be changed after deployment</strong>.&#160; You can do that in the web UI or even automate it through the Azure API.</p>  <h3>2- Use different subscriptions</h3>  <p>In any case, it isn’t recommended to use one Azure subscription for both staging (and/or QA and/or UAT) and production.</p>  <p>The reasons for that is that with a subscription corresponds a Live ID and at most 5 API certificate. Therefore the staff having access to your staging environment would also have access to your production environment.</p>  <p>Therefore, it is recommended to run your environment on different subscriptions and use the staging facility only to swap the production environment quickly.</p>
