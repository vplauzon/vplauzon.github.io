<p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/forrester-sql-azure-raises-the-bar-on-cloud-databases/">Yesterday</a>, I talked about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/itanalyst/docs/11-02-10SQLAzure.PDF">Forrester report</a> around SQL Azure.&#160; Today, I’m gona talk about a Gartner Report on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/appfabric/azure/default.aspx">Windows Azure AppFabric</a>.&#160; The report can be read on:</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" border="0" align="right" src="http://imagesrv.gartner.com/media-products/reprints/images/common/gartnerlogo.gif;pvb53b8361652f91d5" width="129" height="44" /><a title="http://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/reprints/microsoft_mapp/vol2/article14/article14.html" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/reprints/microsoft_mapp/vol2/article14/article14.html">http://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/reprints/microsoft_mapp/vol2/article14/article14.html</a></p>  <p>Basically, the key elements:</p>  <ul>   <li>They acknowledge the fact that cloud computing is a strategic investment for Microsoft, comparing it to the web in the 1990’s. </li>    <li>Microsoft is target the traditional three layers of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS &amp; SaaS) &amp; intend to be a leader in all. </li>    <li>Windows Azure AppFabric has emerged as a core platform technology in Microsoft’s Cloud vision </li>    <li>Many teams are involved in Cloud Computing at Microsoft and as a result, the lack of synchronization between the different delivery creates some confusion </li> </ul>  <p>As for their recommendations:</p>  <ul>   <li>Microsoft should deliver a competitive and complete cloud platform within 2 or 3 years.&#160; Gartner estimates the current state of the platform is incomplete &amp; unproven.&#160; Early adopters should expect bumpy ride.</li>    <li>IT Planners should consider Microsoft as a candidate for cloud computing, but again in the short term, the offer isn’t complete.</li> </ul>  <p>The paper gives a good overview of the platform as it is today.&#160; That alone gives this paper a lot of value, since this information is otherwise quite widespread on Microsoft sites.</p>  <p>I found their recommendation a bit harsh though.&#160; Calling Windows Azure unproven is bit extreme given the amount of sites running it today and the fact that Microsoft is slowly moving their assets into it as well.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://fr.cointreau.be/fichiers/mediaLibrary/common/v_cocktailCointreau.jpg" width="122" height="198" />There is no Gartner curve or quadrant, so I’ll have to rely on my natural verbosity at the next cocktail party!</p>
