<p>The new Facebook mail service will use <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/web-apps">Microsoft Office Web App</a> in order to <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-exec/archive/2010/11/15/office-facebook-easily-share-your-ideas-and-documents-with-friends.aspx">view Microsoft Office documents</a>.</p>  <p>This follows the news of Facebook <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=437112312130">using Bing to search the social network</a>.</p>  <p>It’s interesting to see Microsoft positioning itself in the social networking space and the search space.&#160; It recently abandoned the idea of powering Livre Blog by <a href="http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/6653-microsoft-outsources-blogs-to-wordpress-com">outsourcing it to Wordpress</a>.&#160; I interpreted it as a sign of Microsoft moving away from the social media scene.&#160; Apparently that was more a repositioning than a moving away.</p>  <p>Making alliances with Facebook might work better for Microsoft in the long run than trying to compete with Windows Live.&#160; It’s a shame though, considering that Live Messenger is the most widespread chatting tool and somehow an ancestor of social media.</p>
