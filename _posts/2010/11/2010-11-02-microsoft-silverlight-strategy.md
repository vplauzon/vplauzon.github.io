<p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://martharotter.net/Sl_v_rgb_r.png" width="180" height="201" /></p>  <p>Apparently I wasn’t the only one to notice the <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/html-5-or-silverlight/">lack of vigour behind the Silverlight marketing machine at the PDC last week</a>.&#160; Indeed, that and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834">Bob Moglia’s declarations</a> triggered one of those <a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/207084/486601.aspx">cyber-tsunami</a> internet is famous for.</p>  <p>Moglia, Microsoft President in charge of server and tools business, made an <a href="http://team.silverlight.net/announcement/pdc-and-silverlight/">adjustment statement</a> on his blog yesterday, in order to rectify some things.</p>  <p>Basically, he found people jumped to the conclusion of “Silverlight is dead” pretty fast from his “Silverlight is our development platform for Windows Phone” declaration.&#160; He also emphasizes a few points.&#160; First that SIlverlight is very important and strategic for Microsoft as a cross-browser / cross-browser engine and that’s the de-facto development platform of Windows 7 Phone.</p>  <p>He also shared the strategy of Microsoft on Silverlight.&#160; Basically, Microsoft is observing trends and are trying to “optimize around” those trends:</p>  <ul>   <li>Customers are demanding the richest possible client experiences, and developers are increasingly looking to build premium, tailored experiences optimized for specific devices.</li>    <li>Customers want to be able to deliver client experiences that are optimized for specific form factors.</li>    <li>Media delivery across the Internet continues to accelerate dramatically.&#160; Customers want HD, studio quality, premium media content.</li>    <li>Lastly, there has been massive growth in the breadth and diversity of devices made by a wide variety of vendors providing both open and closed systems.</li> </ul>  <p>Basically, the first three points reinforce the importance of Silverlight.&#160; Microsoft sees the number of devices and form factor increasing and wants its developer base to be able to deliver premium experience on those devices.</p>  <p>The fourth point reinforces the importance of HTML 5:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>When we started Silverlight, the number of unique/different Internet-connected devices in the world was relatively small, and our goal was to provide the most consistent, richest experience across those devices.&#160; But the world has changed.&#160; As a result, getting a single runtime implementation installed on every potential device is practically impossible.&#160; We think HTML will provide the broadest, cross-platform reach across all these devices.&#160; At Microsoft, we’re committed to building the world’s best implementation of HTML 5 for devices running Windows, and at the PDC, we showed the great progress we’re making on this with IE 9. </em></p>    <p><em>The purpose of Silverlight has never been to replace HTML, but rather to do the things that HTML (and other technologies) can’t, and to do so in a way that’s easy for developers to use.&#160; Silverlight enables great client app and media experiences.&#160; It’s now installed on two-thirds of the world’s computers, and more than 600,000 developers currently build software using it.&#160; Make no mistake; we’ll continue to invest in Silverlight and enable developers to build great apps and experiences with it in the future. </em></p> </blockquote>  <p>For me this shades a fair bit of light on the matter.&#160; The way I interpret the strategy is:</p>  <ul>   <li>Silverlight is Microsoft platform to deliver rich experience on different form factors</li>    <li>HTML 5 is the platform to use wherever Silverlight isn’t available:&#160; it offer broader reach.</li> </ul>  <p>For those worries about the disappearance of Silverlight, just think about the movies.&#160; Yes HTML 5 has a movie tag, but from what heard from media content expert, the capacity of HTML 5 is light years for Silverlight’s and…&#160; HTML 5 isn’t a standard yet and <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2008/09/html_5_won_t_be_ready_until_2022dot_yes__2022dot/">won’t be before 2022</a>.&#160; The spec is implemented by quite a few browsers but with different degree of completeness, performance and compatibility.</p>  <p>The last paragraph of Moglia’s blog (quoted above here) is quite interesting:&#160; from the time Silverlight was incepted to the time it started to have a good market penetration (now), the market (and/or Microsoft’s understanding of) changed so much that its original purpose has to be revaluated.&#160; Silverlight was design to be an alternative to Flash.&#160; Well, that didn’t panned out too well I believe.&#160; Except for Microsoft’s sites and those they helped developed, Silverlight isn’t too ubiquitous on the web these days.&#160; That certainly forces some revaluation of the product target.</p>  <p>Doesn’t that remind you of Java?&#160; That technology was build in the early 1990’s as a language for embedded device (hence the name Java, it was suppose to run on your coffee machine), it was last-minute-before-launch revamped as an embedded browser technology (the infamous Java Applet) until it discovered its true mission, a Web Server platform.&#160; The path from embedded device platform to server took 8 years.&#160; Ironically Java did end-up on devices, such as the Android phone.</p>  <p>It evens sounds like Windows, which started, in the middle 1980’s, as a desktop application running on DOS, before becoming a full-blown desktop-OS, then a server-OS and then palm device OS, all with the same GDI+ API!</p>  <p>My point is that technologies do get repurposed as it evolves, especially at the beginning of their lifetime.&#160; With Silverlight on the Windows Phone 7, it practically achieved immortality, so I’m not afraid of seeing it disappear.&#160; I would expect a few changes in purpose in the next few years though.</p>  <p>After all, we are talking about a three years old technology having its fifth major version in a few months despite being based on a slightly older technology (WPF).</p>
