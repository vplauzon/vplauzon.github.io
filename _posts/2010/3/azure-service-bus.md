<p>I’ve found a <a href="http://vasters.com/clemensv/PermaLink,guid,92d78bee-2cfd-4a29-95ab-c5abb9b905e7.aspx">very good article</a> giving a broad overview of the Azure Service Bus.&#160; It’s a blog entry from <a href="http://vasters.com/clemensv">Clemens Vaster</a> who’s working at Microsoft in the Windows Azure team.</p>  <p>Azure Service Bus is part of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/appfabric/">Windows Azure AppFabric</a>.&#160; AppFabric has received much less press than the Azure hosting, storage &amp; SQL Azure.&#160; Maybe because it targets more advanced scenario, maybe because it’s confusing everyone because of its name baring a striking resemblance with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/ee695849.aspx">Windows Server AppFabric</a>, who knows?</p>  <p>Nevertheless, Azure Service Bus has a very powerful architecture allowing parties behind different NATs or firewalls to communicate with each others.&#160; It also allows multicasting information, in a publish-subscribe manner.&#160; This last feature interests me a lot and I’m sure I’ll be blogging about it again and again!</p>
