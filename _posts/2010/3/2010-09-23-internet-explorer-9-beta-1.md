<img title="Internet Explorer 9 Beta" alt="Internet Explorer 9 Beta" src="http://res1.windows.microsoft.com/resbox/en/Internet Explorer/main/d/c/dc779c1f-5a76-4d31-8110-871a4a1c03f4/dc779c1f-5a76-4d31-8110-871a4a1c03f4.jpg" width="221" height="52" />  <p>I finally got around installing the first <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/welcome-upgrade2">beta preview of Internet Explorer 9</a>.&#160; So far, I’m pretty impressed!</p>  <p>It is pretty fast.&#160; Is it the fastest browser?&#160; I got no idea, but it’s fast enough:&#160; I don’t have the feeling of slow browser experience I had since IE 7.&#160; Actually IE 9 even profile the start-up of its plug-ins and propose you to disable slow plug-ins.&#160; I like this new Microsoft approach where they do blame the plug-ins when they do fail (e.g. the new driver model running in User Mode from Vista and after).</p>  <p>The whole site centric thingy isn’t that much of a change.&#160; It’s following Google Chrome trend of removing the toolbar clutter, but compared to a vanilla IE 8, it’s not that different.</p>  <p>Now, one of the big new feature is support for HTML 5 and it does so blazing fast.&#160; It’s like looking at a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130.aspx">WPF</a> application.&#160; Among good examples are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/features/hdgallery">IMDB trailer gallery</a>, the <a href="http://www.visitnmc.com/">National Museum of China</a> virtual visit, <a href="http://webvizbench.com/">Web Viz Bench</a>and <a href="http://www.nevermindthebullets.com/">Never Mind the Bullets</a> (an online comic book).</p>  <p>There are a couple of other goodies, such as ability to pin a web site into Windows 7 task bar.</p>  <p>All around it’s a major version of Internet Explorer and the first beta is fairly stable:&#160; I didn’t have any problems with it.&#160; So I encourage you to try it out!</p>
