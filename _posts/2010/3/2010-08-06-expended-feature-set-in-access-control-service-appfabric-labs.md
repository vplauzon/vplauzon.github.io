<p>Microsoft just released a new feature set on top of Access Control Service (ACS).&#160; It is currently in “incubation” in AppFabric Labs.&#160; The Azure Labs are charge-free developer previews of features.&#160; They should eventually move to “production” with charge patterns.</p>  <p>You can see a quick (5 minutes) demo of it on <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/2010/08/use-social-web-providers-in-less-than-5-minutes/">Wade Wegner blog’s</a>.&#160; Wade is a Microsoft Technical Evangelist for the Windows AppFabric.</p>  <p>The take away for me is that among key new features is an integration with ADFS 2.0.&#160; ACS seems to basically act as a proxy to other identity providers and simplify integration.</p>  <p>It sounds very promising!</p>  <p><strong>[[UPDATE]] </strong>There is also a good and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Identity/Introducing-the-New-Features-of-the-August-Labs-Release-of-the-Access-Control-Service/">informative presentation</a> on channel 9.</p>
