<p>This <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/matthijs/Overview-of-the-Windows-Phone-7-Application-Platform/">DevDays 2010 presentation</a> from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ckindel/">Charlie Kindel</a> gives a very good overview of Windows Phone 7 Series.</p>  <p><img src="http://images.tothetech.com/2010/02/windows-phone-7-series.jpg" width="498" height="500" /></p>  <p>It first goes into the motivations for building a new Phone OS and what vision they had for it.&#160; Then it goes into the different development features and how it connects to the vision.</p>  <p>For instance, one of the objectives was to have the phone being customizable.&#160; One of the main way to do that is to install applications &amp; games.&#160; Now, for this to really work, the application model needs to be predictable so that a given game wouldnâ€™t degrade the entire experience.&#160; This is why they went with a managed application model, ie .NET (via Silverlight and XNA):&#160; applications are verified prior to execution.</p>  <p>Very nice introduction to a promising product.</p>
