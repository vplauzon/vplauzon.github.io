<p>A big mile stone for the Windows Phone 7:&#160; <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2010/09/01/windows-phone-7-released-to-manufacturing.aspx">Release to Market</a> (RTM) of its OS.</p>  <p>With a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/a-billion-to-launch-windows-phone-7-i-bet-microsoft-is-paying-a-lot-more/7238">billion dollars marketing campaign</a>, it brings to mind the campaign done for Windows 95 launch.&#160; Let’s hope the Windows Phone 7 will be as transformative as Windows 95 was.&#160;&#160; The current Windows Phone looks so 2000’s :(</p>  <p>I’m actually confident that Microsoft could get a large market share with time.&#160; Their approach is much more open than Apple’s and their service much better than Google’s.</p>  <p>Let’s see how it goes!</p>
