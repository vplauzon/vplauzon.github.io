<p>I just published a new article on CodeProject:</p>  <p><a title="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webservices/WCFDataServices.aspx" href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webservices/WCFDataServices.aspx">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webservices/WCFDataServices.aspx</a></p>  <p>It hasn’t been reviewed yet.</p>  <p>In that article I do showcase different ways to use OData to expose your data using WCF Data Services.&#160; The samples grow in complexity, going from the standard hello world of WCF Data Services (ie exposing your DB on a web endpoint), to more advanced scenarios (e.g. transforming your data or even exposing data not coming from a database).&#160; I also show a way to consume OData in a .NET Client.</p>  <p>I believe OData is going to gain more and more tractions as different client and server products include support for it.&#160; It’s a really neat way of exposing data that is queryable but from the middle tier, hence giving you much more flexibility than exposing a database server directly.</p>
