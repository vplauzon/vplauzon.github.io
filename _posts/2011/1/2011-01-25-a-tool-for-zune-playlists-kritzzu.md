<p>If, like me, you manage your playlists pretty much by folders on your source PC, you probably end up finding it frustrating to use Zune in order to create those playlists on your Windows Phone 7.</p>  <p>Desperate no more.&#160; There’s a tool I found on a blog allowing you to create those playlist in a few keystrokes, KrizZu:</p>  <p><a title="http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2008/12/kritzu-zune-playlist-generator-based-on.html" href="http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2008/12/kritzu-zune-playlist-generator-based-on.html">http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2008/12/kritzu-zune-playlist-generator-based-on.html</a></p>  <p>The tool’s author, Vishal Joshi, offers it for free.</p>  <p>It’s a simple WPF application.&#160; Zune’s playlist are stored in xml files and KritzZu simply generate those xml files.</p>  <p>Still, it saved me quite a few minutes!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p>
