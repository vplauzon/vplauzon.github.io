<p>The first update of the Windows Phone 7 is coming soon.&#160; Some people say end-of January others, mid-February 2011.</p>  <p>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/features/update-info.aspx">started to release information</a> about the new features.</p>  <p>Not much is known at the moment:</p>  <ul>   <li>Cut &amp; Paste</li>    <li>Faster start-up and resume of apps &amp; games</li>    <li>Better marketplace search</li> </ul>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" alt="copy and paste" align="left" src="http://www.microsoft.com/global/windowsphone/en-us/PublishingImages/features/CnP_demo_email_screen.jpg" />I suppose there will be a little more in the bag, but nothing else seems official today.</p>
