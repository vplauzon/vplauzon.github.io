<p><a href="http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/surface20.png?tag=mantle_skin;content"><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" title="surface20" alt="" align="right" src="http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/surface20.png" width="475" height="317" /></a>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/ces-microsoft-shows-off-surface-20/8349">shown the new Surface table at the CES show</a>.</p>  <p>The new device is able to be either horizontal or vertical (v 1.0 was horizontal only), is coming with Windows 7 loaded on an AMD Athlon II X2 Dual-Core Processor 2.9GHz and a GPU AMD Radeon HD 6700M Series.</p>  <p>The screen is 40 inches (16:9) while the table is 4 inches tick, made out of <a href="http://www.corninggorillaglass.com/">Gorilla glass</a>.&#160; This includes everything:&#160; the cameras, computer, etc.&#160; .&#160; So this is a huge difference compare to the first version of the table!</p>  <p>If you want one in your leaving room, you’ll only need to fork $US 7600.</p> <img src="http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/samsungsurface.png?tag=mantle_skin;content" />  <p></p>  <p>I’ve worked with the Surface 1.0.&#160; The company I was working for, a Microsoft Partner, was trying to find ways to use the Surface table to help customers.&#160; Above easily doing very attractive applications, we never found a customer interested to invest in it.&#160; The problems we did hit were:</p>  <ul>   <li>The price ($10K-$20K / table) per unit was too high</li>    <li>There was not enough applications available (no ecosystem), which meant the customer had to heavily invest in custom development</li>    <li>Different logistic problems:&#160; the table was too small to realistically work many around it, the horizontal position meant it wasn’t comfortable to work for a long period of time around it (imagine watching a TV on the floor), etc.</li> </ul>  <p>The new table addresses some of the issue:&#160; the price tag is lower, the dimension are better and it can sit straight.&#160; The ecosystem is probably still quite sparse though.</p>  <p>The only interested customers we found were after a marketing device and for those application the new table might actually do the trick and hit the sweet spot.</p>  <p>Before you see the table on your financial planner desk (as seen in Surface demos), you might have to age a little though!</p>
