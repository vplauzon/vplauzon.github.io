<p>I <a href="https://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/biztalk-vnext-biztalk-azure/">recently blogged</a> about the future of BizTalk and the roadmap of the product version Windows AppFabric.</p>  <p>An even more recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/billzack/archive/2010/12/08/biztalk-the-road-ahead.aspx">blog post</a> shed some light on the topic.</p>  <p><img title="Biztalk Executive Summary" alt="Biztalk Executive Summary" src="http://i.microsoft.com/global/biztalk/en/us/PublishingImages/BTS-Roadmap.jpg" /></p>  <blockquote>   <p>We are planning to invest in the following main areas:</p>    <ul>     <li>       <p><b>Deep Microsoft Application Platform Alignment </b></p>     </li>      <li>       <p><b>Enterprise Connectivity for Windows Server AppFabric</b></p>     </li>      <li>       <p><b>On-Premise Server and Cloud Service Symmetry</b></p>     </li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>The three bullet points are interesting.</p>  <p>Basically, we should see BizTalk being less of a satellite product and getting more aligned with the platform.&#160; Here I suppose we are talking about WF 4.0, WCF (e.g. Routing), AppFabric, SharePoint, etc.&#160; .&#160; But should also see Windows Azure AppFabric embracing more and more business integration features to a point of equating BizTalk server on premise.</p>  <p>The idea of having your ESB in the cloud might seem a bit far fetch since itâ€™s quite essential to your operations.&#160; But actually, because it is so essential, and because Enterprises are using ESBs for more services with more volume, the reliability and infinite scalability of the cloud becomes a very interesting attribute indeed.</p>
