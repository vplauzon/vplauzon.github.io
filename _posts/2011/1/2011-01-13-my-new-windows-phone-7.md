<p>I finally got into it and bought a Windows Phone 7!</p>  <p>The device is an HTC Surround.&#160; I’m sure you’ve read plenty of reviews, so here’s just a list of pros and cons of the new OS.</p>  <p>To give some context, I’m not a huge gadget consumer.&#160; My previous similar device was an iPod Touch first generation.&#160; My previous phone dated from 2003 and was just a phone (oh, it could also SMS!).</p>  <p><img style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="HTC 7 Surround™ - " src="http://www.telusmobility.com/en/common/images/products/phones/lg/htc_7_surround.jpg" />First the pros.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" src="http://www.stud.u-szeged.hu/Csesznegi.Katalin/800px-Smiley_svg.png" width="50" height="50" /></p>  <p>What strikes in the first minutes using the phone was how crystal clear the text is.&#160; The letters are crisp and the text reads itself without tiring the eyes.&#160; I use my phone to read a lot (e.g. during public transport commute) and it is a very enjoyable experience on that device.&#160; I don’t know if it’s some funky fonts, Silverlight or just the screen resolution, but compare to the first iPod touch (I hear the iPhone 4 has an incredible screen which I haven’t experimented), it is way sharper.</p>  <p>The <em>People Hub</em>, or contact management, is also very well done.&#160; It’s super easy to merge your Windows Live &amp; Facebook contacts and link them together (e.g. <a href="mailto:john.smith@hotmail.com">john.smith@hotmail.com</a> is the same contact than «John Smith» on Facebook).&#160; You can add information on those contacts, for instance their phone number if they’re not sharing them on Windows Live already, or a different photo.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" alt="Image: Zune Marketplace" align="right" src="http://www.zune.net/NR/rdonlyres/B22A39E7-33D7-41FD-A964-CD610E804153/0/460x280_zunemarketplace_v2.jpg" width="460" height="280" /></p>  <p>The management of photos &amp; videos is also efficient.&#160; You can see your albums on Windows Live &amp; Facebook and the photos / videos you’ve taken with you phone or that you’ve synked on it.&#160; Very intuitive, very quick.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The entire Metro interface is quite cool, easy to navigate, intuitive and efficient.&#160; You get proficient very quickly.&#160; You can customize your phone to put the hubs you’re using the most where you want.&#160; You can even have a contact as a first class shortcut on the landing page.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.mr-gadget.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Marketplacehub_US_print.jpg" width="240" height="183" />The Zune software is way better than iTunes.&#160; iTunes always felt like a Macintosh virtual machine running on my poor Windows box.&#160; Zune doesn’t.&#160; It starts quickly, sync quickly, in the background and when there’s nothing to sync, it doesn’t go through a lengthy cycle in order to sync nothing.&#160; It has a sexy WPF UI which is quite easy to use.&#160; The only caveat is that while Zune is online, you can’t listen to movies or music.&#160; This is a little annoying if you’re only recharging your device.&#160; The workaround is simple though:&#160; shut down Zune, keep the phone connected and you’re good.</p>  <p>The Marketplace surprised me.&#160; 2 months after the launch, there’s already a lot of applications.&#160; The ratio of crap applications is way lower than on Apple app-store.&#160; The fact that Silverlight is the API probably help a lot.&#160; The next version should include a better search since they are basically victim of their own success!</p>  <p>Now the cons, or the point I would like to see improved:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.so-sticky.com/catalog/images/SMILEY%20SAD.JPG" width="50" height="42" /></p>  <p>You’ve heard it elsewhere, but it is quite annoying:&#160; there is no Cut &amp; Paste!&#160; It will be fixed in the next version of the OS in a couple of weeks, so…&#160; next!</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://www.monterey.org/recycle/images/battery.jpg" width="240" height="180" />One of the inconvenience of this phone, it might be unique to the HTC Surround, I don’t know, is the battery.&#160; Gee!&#160; You watch 60 minutes of videos and half your battery is gone!&#160; It’s hard to pass the day without plugging it!&#160; I find myself deactivating the Wi-Fi all the time in the hope of gaining some minutes of electricity independence.</p>  <p>Something I miss from my iPod Touch is the easy access to the media player when the phone is locked.&#160; On iPod, you can double-click the main button and the play / pause / forward / backward buttons appear on the screen.&#160; No such luxury on the Windows Phone 7 yet.&#160; You do have a mini media player appearing once you unlock the phone but it stays there only for a limited time.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.sitelcom.es/wp-content/uploads/image/pdf_logo.jpg" width="80" height="101" />The next negative point isn’t about the Windows Phone 7 OS per se, but the PDF Reader provided as an extra.&#160; In one sentence:&#160; it sucks!&#160; It’s basically way too sensitive to finger motion which makes it shaky and extremely annoying.&#160; It doesn’t suffer from comparison though, since it also sucked on the iPod.&#160; Apparently the developers at Adobe have extremely good finger control or an extreme resistance to motion sickness.</p>  <p>There are no way to synchronise my PC’s favourite to my phone.</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="right" src="http://earth911.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/envelope-mail.jpg" width="100" height="100" />The handling of mail is also sub part.&#160; I’m using Yahoo as my main private email provider and the integration is so-so.&#160; Yes, I can read and send email, but the process of receiving email is byzantine at best.&#160; On my iPod Touch, I could simply go to a mail folder and press refresh ; within few seconds the device was downloading the new messages.&#160; With Windows Phone 7, you have to subscribe to mail folders in order to ‘sync’ them.&#160; Now the sync process takes forever, as in above 10 seconds.&#160; Totally unacceptable.&#160; If I’m in my inbox, I don’t want the device to sync all my folders, I just want to see if I have new mails!</p>  <p>Now this is not the only thing bad about emails on my phone.&#160; On the landing page of the phone, you can see how many new emails you have on the email hub icon.&#160; Well…&#160; that is until you open the hub.&#160; Then, even if you don’t look at any of the new mails, your count drops to zero on the main screen.&#160; And…&#160; I just discovered it this morning:&#160; when you delete a message, it doesn’t go in the special trash folder, it goes in a ‘deleted items’ mail folder that the phone just created for you!&#160; That’s just fantastic!&#160; So now you have a way to know if you deleted you mails from your phone or from elsewhere and those that were deleted from your phone are never deleted, they are just moved to a folder you never created!&#160; A big round of applause for that feature!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Anyhow, despite those little annoyances, the Windows Phone 7 is a very nice device to use.&#160; I’m looking forward for the next refresh of the OS to enjoy the real potential of the phone.&#160; So far, extremely great device to read with and great for keeping in touch with my contacts and listen / watch multi-media.</p>
