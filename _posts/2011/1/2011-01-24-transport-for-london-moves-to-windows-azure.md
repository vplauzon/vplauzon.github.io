<p>I follow quite closely Windows Azure Team blog.&#160; Many of the blog entries consist in “<em>Real World Windows Azure</em>” article where they interview company executive who just moved a piece of mission critical asset from their premise to the cloud using Windows Azure.</p>  <p>I still wait to see a Canadian example of those post, but so far nothing came by! <img src="http://www.pixelperfectdigital.com/free_stock_photos/data/569/medium/1137686487-2633.jpg" width="80" height="67" /></p>  <p>But…&#160; a quite interesting variant on those articles was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2010/12/13/transport-for-london-moves-to-windows-azure.aspx">published in mid-December</a>.&#160; This was a much bigger asset than usual and Microsoft did a special announcement.</p>  <p><a href="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/image.png"><img style="border-bottom:0;border-left:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://vincentlauzon.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="49" /></a> The Transport for London (TfL) Trackernet data feed is now hosted in Windows Azure.&#160; This is a real time feed about the status of the transport network.</p>  <p>I found it especially interesting because the size and the visibility of the application.&#160; Sure, we’ve seen a lot of start up trying it out over the last couple of months, but TfL is an established institution, European at that, moving a key piece of public asset to the cloud.&#160; This is an excellent credential!</p>  <p><img src="http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/london/va100-mt.jpg" width="900" height="600" /></p>
