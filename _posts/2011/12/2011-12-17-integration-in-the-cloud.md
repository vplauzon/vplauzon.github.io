<p>I ran across a series of good blog posts I wanted to share with you, dear readers.</p>  <p>From <a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/about/">Richard Seroter</a>, the series is about <a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/integration-in-the-cloud-part-1-introduction/">integration patterns in the cloud</a>, looking at cloud-to-cloud &amp; cloud-to-on-premise scenarios.</p>  <p>Richard looks at three main patterns:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/integration-in-the-cloud-part-2-shared-database-pattern/">Shared Database</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/integration-in-the-cloud-part-3-remote-procedure-invocation-pattern/">Remote Procedure Invocation</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://seroter.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/integration-in-the-cloud-part-4-asynchronous-messaging-pattern/">Asynchronous Messaging</a> </li> </ul>  <p>For each pattern, Richard describe the pattern, the general challenges, the challenges specifically related to the cloud and finally he demonstrates the pattern using different cloud provider (e.g. Google, Amazon, Azure).</p>  <p>His text is very thorough yet straight to the point.&#160; He puts his fingers on the right issues.&#160; Great work Richard!</p>
