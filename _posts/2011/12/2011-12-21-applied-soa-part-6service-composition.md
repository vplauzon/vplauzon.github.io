<p>This is part of a series of blog post about Applied SOA. The past blog entries are:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/applied-soa-part-1-introduction/">Introduction</a></li>    <li><a title="Preview “Applied SOA- Part 2 – SOA Basics”" href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/applied-soa-part-2-soa-basics/">SOA Basics</a></li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/applied-soa-part-3-service-discovery-process/">Service Discovery Process</a></li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/applied-soa-part-4-service-taxonomy/">Service Taxonomy</a></li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/applied-soa-part-5-interoperability/">Interoperability</a></li> </ul>  <p>In this article, I’ll quickly cover service composition.</p>  <p>Service Composition is often stated as a goal of SOA.&#160; I think it’s rather a <em>consequence </em>of a Service Oriented Architecture.&#160; You first deploy building block-type of services.&#160; Once those are running, you can start deploying <em>higher order</em> services <em>reusing </em>those building blocks.</p>  <p>As we’ve seen in the <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/applied-soa-part-4-service-taxonomy/">Service Taxonomy blog entry</a>, a good service taxonomy helps you to structure service composition.&#160; The one I presented, from <a href="http://soapatterns.org">soapatterns.org</a>, has composition built-in.&#160; Typically, a business processes compose many services.&#160; An activity within a process might also compose a few more agnostic services.</p>  <p>Composition is good, it’s incarnated reuse, so we should want it everywhere, shouldn’t we?&#160; Well, like with everything sweet, there’s a tension related to its usage.&#160; In the case of composition, this tension is with isolation.&#160; As we’ve seen in <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/applied-soa-part-2-soa-basics/">different SOA definitions</a>, isolation is important.&#160; Composition compromises isolation in many ways:</p>  <ul>   <li>It couples SLA:&#160; the composing service is just as strong as its weakest link at any moment in time.</li>    <li>It couples services time-wise:&#160; composition increases latency but also require the composed service to be up-and-running.</li>    <li>It also often couples service contracts if the composing service expose data from the composed services.&#160; One way or the other, changes in the composed service will affect the composing service.</li> </ul>  <p>This tension is the reason why you won’t want to layer your services in many layers.&#160; Doing so would result in weak SLA, long response time and high-maintenance.&#160; If you do not layer at all, you’ll end up with duplicated logic.&#160; As usual, patterns and judgement should help you balance your solution!</p>
