<p>Do not miss my <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en/blog/cloud/testing-out-public-cloud">first entry</a> into <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en/blog/cloud">CGI’s cloud blog</a>!</p>  <p>I work for CGI (31K headcount IT Consulting international company based in Montreal, Canada) for a year now.&#160; CGI has been developing a cloud offering for Enterprises and we’ve started a blog around it to get the word out.</p>  <p>My expertise lies more around Windows Azure &amp; the public cloud in general which is a nice complement to CGI’s offering, hence my contribution.</p>  <p>Enjoy it!</p>
