<p>Far from fancy technological questions today…</p>  <p>How do you configure Microsoft Word to assign numbers to your section headers in a hierarchical way, e.g.:</p>  <ul>   <li>Header 1 (1)</li>    <li>Header 1 (2)</li>    <li>Header 2 (2.1)</li>    <li>Header 2 (2.2)</li>    <li>Header 3 (2.2.1)</li> </ul>  <p>etc.?</p>  <p><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" align="left" src="http://www.getproductbestprice.com/images_products/Microsoft_Word_2010_for_sale.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></p>  <p>Well, maybe you’re in my position and you always had documents configured properly but today you have to configure one yourself.</p>  <p>It turns out it’s far from trivial.&#160; There are no ‘activate hierarchical header numbering’ in Word!</p>  <p>Instead of explaining here, I’ll refer you to the excellent article Shauna Kelly (who seems to be a <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Shauna.Kelly">black belt in template document</a>):</p>  <p><a title="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/outlinenumbering.html" href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/outlinenumbering.html">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/outlinenumbering.html</a></p>  <p>The short story is that you have to create a multilevel list, configure it (by default it doesn’t carry its parent sections number and the indentation increases at each level) and associate each level to a header style.&#160; There are bumps along the road on each steps, so be careful!</p>
