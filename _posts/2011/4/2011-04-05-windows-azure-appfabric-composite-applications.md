<p>There was some confusing mentions about composite applications in the cloud at the <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/pdc-2010-keynotes/">PDC 2010</a>, but we haven’t heard much about it since then.</p>  <p>Last month Itai Raz from the Windows Azure AppFabric Team wrote a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazureappfabric/archive/2011/03/10/introduction-to-windows-azure-appfabric-blog-posts-series-part-4-building-composite-applications.aspx">blog about Composite Applications in AppFabric</a>.</p>  <p>Like many I didn’t fully understand where that product was going at the PDC 2010.&#160; But now it makes more sense.</p>  <p>It’s basically a way to model your application at a high level (e.g. I want web role, caching and a DB) and deploy it in AppFabric.&#160; AppFabric knows how your application is built and can therefore monitor it and allow you to change some aspects of it at runtime.</p>  <p><img border="0" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-01-12-07/3652.Comp-App-Dev-Experience.png" /></p>  <p>In many ways, it is what Azure Hosting (the basic Windows Azure) does, but on steroids.&#160; Windows Azure already has an abstraction above your processes.&#160; It knows about the roles you deploy so it can move them around in time.&#160; Well, <em>Composite App</em> is a step up in that model.</p>  <p>On the other hand, you can consider Composite App as a cloud extension of what <em>Windows Server AppFabric</em> does:&#160; hosts WCF + WF, monitor, etc.</p>  <p>Composite App currently is in CTP, available at <a title="https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/" href="https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/">https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/</a>.&#160; You can watch the PDC 2010 video about it <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC10/CS04">here</a>.</p>  <p>It is looking like AppFabric really is lifting of to become a <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/gartner-on-windows-azure-appfabric-a-strategic-core-of-microsofts-cloud-platform/">core of Microsoft’s cloud platform</a>:&#160; compare the following picture to last year’s (when we only had the first two services) and you’ll see where the investment is going.</p>  <p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-01-12-07/1488.appfabric-services.png" /></p>
