<p>Back in summer 2010 I did a proof of concept around Windows Azure &amp; ADFS.&#160; The challenge was:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font>How can we deploy a departmental application in the cloud and have employees connecting on it using their corporate account?</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>Basically, how to project a corporate account in the cloud?</p>  <p>This was before Azure AppFabric Access Control.&#160; The solution had a web application using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) directly.</p>  <p>I did blog the experience of that POC over here:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/departmental-application-migration-to-azure-part-1/">Departmental Application Migration to Azure – Part 1</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/departmental-application-migration-to-azure-part-2-adfs-installation/">Departmental Application Migration to Azure – Part 2 – ADFS Installation</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/departmental-application-migration-to-azure-part-3-adfs-with-on-premise-web-app/">Departmental Application Migration to Azure – Part 3 – ADFS with on-premise web app</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/departmental-application-migration-to-azure-part-4-adfs-with-azure-web-app/">Departmental Application Migration to Azure – Part 4 – ADFS with Azure web app</a> </li> </ul>
