<p>I wrote a <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/sql-azure-acid-transactions-back-to-2001/">blog entry back in November 2010</a> about ACID Transactions &amp; SQL Azure.</p>  <p>I assumed light transactions using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.transactionscope.aspx">System.Transactions.TransactionScope</a> were not supported based on an article I’ve just read back then.&#160; The article suggested using explicit transaction management (i.e. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/86773566.aspx">BeginTransaction</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqltransaction.commit.aspx">Commit</a> &amp; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zayx5s0h.aspx">Rollback</a> on the returned <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqltransaction.aspx">SqlTransaction</a> object) which I found quite backward, hence the title:&#160; back to 2001.</p>  <p>I went as far as creating an entry on <a href="http://www.mygreatwindowsazureidea.com/forums/34192-windows-azure-feature-voting/suggestions/1256411-support-transactionscope-for-light-transaction">My Great Windows Azure Idea</a> requesting the ability to use <em>TransactionScope</em> for light transaction-only.</p>  <p>Well, it turns out I was wrong and you do not have to go that close to the metal:&#160; <em>TransactionScope</em> is already supported as long you don’t enlist more than one connection into, in which case it would escalate to a distributed transaction, which isn’t supported in SQL Azure.</p>  <p>The article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee336245.aspx#ts">I referred to back then</a> has been revised to make that point explicit in the mean time, so I’m correcting my blog entry here.&#160; You can also read some more about it <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/handling-transactions-in-sql-azure.aspx">here</a>.</p>  <p>Sorry about the misleading and thank you Luis Panzano for pointing that out to me!</p>
