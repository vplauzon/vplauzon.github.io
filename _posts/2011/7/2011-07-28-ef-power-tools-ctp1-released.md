<p>A little while ago, Microsoft released the <a title="EF Power Tools Visual Studio Gallery Download" href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/72a60b14-1581-4b9b-89f2-846072eff19d" target="_blank">first CTP of Entity Framework Power Tools</a>.</p>  <p>Those power tools work on top of EF 4.1 and provide the following exciting features:</p>  <ul>   <li>Reverse Engineer a Code First Model from an existing database.&#160; Now this comes with the caveat that everything is configured through the fluent API even when convention would have been sufficient.&#160; In the future, this might be optimized. </li>    <li>For any existing class derived from <strong>DbContext</strong>:       <ul>       <li>See the entity data model:&#160; the same designer view as for model-first, but read-only</li>        <li>See corresponding EDMX (XML representation of the model)</li>        <li>See SQL DDL (SQL schema generated by Code First)</li>        <li>Generate a pre-compiled version of the model to improve start-up performance</li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>In a lot of scenarios, you might have an existing database or a database you want to design directly (schema first) but you still want a lot of properties of the code-first paradigm (e.g. POCO objects).&#160; This power tool kit removes the friction of using EF code-first in such scenarios.</p>
