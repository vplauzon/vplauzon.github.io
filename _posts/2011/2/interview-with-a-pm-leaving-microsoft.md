<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft">Mary-Jo Foley</a> has an interesting <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/can-an-open-source-backer-thrive-inside-microsoft-this-one-says-no/9545">interview with Hamilton Verissimo</a>, the founder of the open-source Castle Project, who has been a PM in the .NET Fx team.</p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hammett"><img style="display:inline;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;" alt="hamilton verissimo" align="left" src="http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/1287089673/Untitled_reasonably_small.png" /></a>He tells about his frustration about the company.&#160; Of course, the interview is one-sided but it does pull the veil on the internal working of Microsoft company, which I always found instructive.</p>  <p>He reveals, for instance, that in his opinion, Microsoft follows a very waterfall process and that a small fraction of the resource (i.e. development team time) is spent actually creating new code.</p>  <p>As I said, the interview is one-sided and it was obvious from the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/open-source-castle-project-founder-joins-microsoft/1491">get go</a> that Verissimo was incompatible with Microsoftâ€™s culture.&#160; It might just be a cultural shock from somebody used to work in start-ups facing the structure of a massive company.&#160; Nevertheless, the comments are interesting to read.</p>
