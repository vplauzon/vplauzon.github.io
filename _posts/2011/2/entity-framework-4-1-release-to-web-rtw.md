<p>Two weeks ago, <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/entity-framework-4-1-rc-including-code-first/">Microsoft published a Release Candidate (RC)&#160; of Entity Framework 4.1</a>.&#160; They promised to release the product within 4 weeks.</p>  <p>Well, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2011/04/11/ef-4-1-released.aspx">they released it today</a>!</p>  <p>So you can now use Entity Framework 4.1 which is a fully supported Microsoft Product.</p>  <p>The only change done from the RC is <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/entity-framework-4-1-override-conventions-2/">the default length of nvarchar from 128 to <em>MAX</em></a>.</p>  <p>You can follow <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/entity-framework-4-1-deep-fetch-vs-lazy-load-3/">my series of blog on Entity Framework 4.1</a> to learn more about the technology.</p>
