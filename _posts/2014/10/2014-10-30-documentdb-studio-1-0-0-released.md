<p>Yes, the first non-beta version!
</p><p>Ok, what is the difference between the betas and this one?  Alpha, Beta and RC are always separated by arbitrary grass lanes…
</p><p>For DocumentDB Studio, I was waiting to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimal Viable Product</a> (MVP) and for me the MVP was related to be able to query document collections.
</p><p>Version 1.0.0 does allow you to query documents.
</p><p>I'll give more elaborate information with demos in another post within the next few days but you can <a href="https://studiodocumentdb.codeplex.com/">download it</a> now!

 </p><p>Enjoy!</p>
