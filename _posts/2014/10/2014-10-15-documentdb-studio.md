<p>I finally done a first release of my latest project, <a href="https://studiodocumentdb.codeplex.com/">DocumentDB Studio</a>!
</p><p><img align="right" src="assets/2014/10/documentdb-studio/101614_0240_documentdbs11.png" alt="" /><em>DocumentDB Studio</em> is to <a href="http://vincentlauzon.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/digest-documentdb-resource-model-and-concepts/">Azure DocumentDB</a> what SQL Management Studio is to SQL Server and SQL Azure: a one-stop shop to manage and interact with your DocumentDB.
</p><p>The first release is quite minimalist and only let you:
</p><ul><li>Connect to different DocumentDB accounts
</li><li>Create / delete databases within those accounts
</li><li>Create / delete collections within databases
</li></ul><p>The next release should include ability to perform document insertion and queries.
</p><p>I did start this project in order to palliate the lack of tool for Azure DocumentDB.  That product is very interesting but I feel that having to <strong>code</strong> in order to toy with it is too high an entry barrier.
</p><p>Document Studio aims at lowering the entry barrier and let potential users play around with the product.
</p><p>Stay tune for more details on that project!</p>
