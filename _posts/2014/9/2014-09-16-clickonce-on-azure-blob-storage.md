<p>You want to deploy a ClickOnce solution on the web.  You are an Azure person and hesitate on how to deploy that using Azure Web Site…
</p><p>Don't.  Use Blob Storage instead:  cheaper, easier and faster.
</p><p>On top of that, RobinDotNet has a <a href="http://robindotnet.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/how-to-host-a-clickonce-deployment-in-azure-blob-storage/">wonderful blog entry</a> walking you through the details.
