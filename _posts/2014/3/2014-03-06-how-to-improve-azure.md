<p>I'm very passionate about Windows Azure.  I've been using and promoting the platform for more than four (4) years now.
</p><p>So I've been working with the technology for a while but in the recent month I've been involved on an intensive architecture project where we pushed the envelope of the platform.  As a consequence we did hit quite a few limitation of the platform.
</p><p>I also had the pleasure of working directly with Microsoft to resolve some of those issues.
</p><p>In this blog series I will address what still remain to this date (March 2014) limitations of the platform.  Instead of winning about it, I will suggest ways Azure could be improve to address those shortcomings.  That will be more constructive and will generate some discussion.  Feel free to jump in the discussion in the comments section!
