Let's talk about [Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) (ADX ![ADX](/assets/posts/2020/1/azure-data-explorer-kusto/logo-analytics-145-Azure-Data-Explorer-Clusters.svg)).

If you ask me that is the best kept secret in Azure.

Well, it isn't exactly a secret but most people do not know about it or if they do just think of it as the back-end engine behind [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview).

ADX is an Azure Data Service.  It is ideal to analyze large volume of data.

Isn't that what [Azure Datawarehouse](https://vincentlauzon.com/2016/07/31/how-does-azure-data-warehouse-scale/) is supposed to do?  Or [Azure Databricks](https://vincentlauzon.com/2017/12/18/azure-databricks-getting-started/)?  Actually, there is an entire [category of Analytics Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#analytics) ADX is part of.

In this article, I'll go around characteristics of the Service:  what its strenght are and where it is complemented by other services.

## Scale

## Data Exploration

## Ad Hoc Queries - Fast

## Big Data Analytics - Fast

## Structured, Semi-Structured & Unstructured - Fast

## Near real time ingestion

## Data Transformation

## Integration

## Summary
