A new year, a new decade, a new blogging platform for me!

I've been blogging for just shy of [10 years](https://vincentlauzon.com/2010/04/21/moving-my-blog-here/).

So far, I was hosting my blog on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/).  I just moved to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

My blog is still here, hopefully the content is easier to read and my readers will enjoy the new platform!

## Why moving away from Wordpress.com?

Ads

I was only paying for my own domain name, so I didn't have any plan on the site.

You know what they say:  if you don't pay for a product then you are the product.

I was comfortable with the ads at first.  Like many platforms they got more hungry with time.

The thing is that I didn't notice the growth since %99 of the time, I would be looking at my site *logged in as myself*.  Since I was the site's owner, I didn't see any ads.

One day I pasted an article in a Microsoft Teams' meeting with a customer and when he opened it while sharing his screen, I was disgusted by the number of ads (sometimes more than one per scrolling page).  Those ads were not even related to my content:  typically, it was some health gimmick.

I considered upgrading to a plan, but it came with a hefty price tag, so I started shopping around.

## Why choosing GitHub pages?

I saw a couple of sites being hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It looked lean and efficient.  The integration with GitHub was interesting to me.

The thing is I wasn't using Wordpress.com platform very well.  For the last year at least, I was writing in markdown using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Having something hooked up to GitHub would have made more sense.

I started to dive into the underlying platform:  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  That lighted up another dormant interest:  static sites.

And then came the challenge:  how do you implement a blog (essentially a CMS) with a static site?

The details are for another day, but there was a bit of fun Azure development involved.

## What is the same

My last ten years content is there, with the same URLs.

There is still an [RSS Feed](/feed/).

We can still leave comments.

We can still search.

And now that I'm done setting this up, I'll start posting more often!

## What changed

This blog isn't linked to Wordpress.com so the login of users from Wordpress isn't there.

The cross-referencing of posts isn't there.

Notifications aren't present anymore.

Bunch of behind the scene stuff that do not impact visitors.

## What is coming

In the next couple of months, I would like to implement:

*   Social media login
    * To facilitate leaving comments and getting notified
* Notifications
    * For both new posts and comments
* Couple of things behind the scene to make my life easier

Also, I'll be blogging about the Azure apparatus I've put around GitHub pages!
