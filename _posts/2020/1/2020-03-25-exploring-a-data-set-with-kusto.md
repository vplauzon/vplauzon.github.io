We discussed Azure Data Explorer (ADX) and its query language Kusto in a <span style="background-color:yellow">Past article</span>.

In this article, I would like to look at a simple exploration scenario.

We'll download csv files from the web, put them in an Azure Storage Account and from there, we'll do everything in Azure Data Explorer and Kusto.

We'll ingest the data, transform it, then do some slicing and dicing and visualizing to better understand the data.

This is quite a typical scenario when dealing with new data and as we'll see, it is very natural in Kusto.

As usual, [code is in GitHub](https://github.com/vplauzon/kusto/tree/master/imdb).
