Yes this week we have Kusto & a Kitty.  Can't get better than that ;)

We discussed ingestion in Azure Data Explorer / Kusto at length in [past articles](/2020/06/03/ingesting-histocical-data-at-scale-with-kusto).  We mentionned *queued ingestion* along the ride without diving much into it.  Let's do that now.

Queued ingestion is the mechanism used by Kusto when doing [Event Grid subscription ingestion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/data-ingestion/eventgrid).  Kusto queues blobs as they come in near real time.

The key word here is **queued**.  Most ingestion methods in Kusto unqueued (e.g. [.ingest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/data-ingestion/ingest-from-storage), [.ingest inline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/data-ingestion/ingest-inline), [from query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/data-ingestion/ingest-from-query), etc.).  The `async` keyword doesn't mean queued ; it only means the query returns to the client (with the *operation ID* to monitor progress).  But if the ingestion fails or if the cluster goes down, the ingestion fails forever.

Queued ingestion is different.  Queued blob will eventually be processed and retried a few times before Kusto give up on them.  It had many advantages:

* Reliability
* Managing load:  We can queued petabytes of blob without overloading our cluster
* Maximize cluster usage:  the ingestion (once queued) is managed by Kusto as opposed to an external agent, hence it can maximize resource usage

Queued ingestion is available [in the SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-queued-ingest-sample) and can be [performed using REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-queued-ingest-sample).  The problem is that it isn't one REST API.  It's an orchestration of several (three to be exact) REST APIs that are encapsulated in the SDK.

I find it convenient to have a REST API for ingestion so I made one using a Logic App.  This article explains how it is build and how to use it.

As usual, [code is in GitHub](https://github.com/vplauzon/kusto/tree/master/rest-ingest-api).
