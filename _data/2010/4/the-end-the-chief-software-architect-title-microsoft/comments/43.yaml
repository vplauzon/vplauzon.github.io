content: "I think succession of the head office in Microsoft become more like honorary position. The dynamics within Microsoft is already in place and the train is on the truck. I agree that there are lot of challenges ahead as new emerging lead technological companies are emerging. Still Microsoft holds very competitive products. It may be losing in the mobile and internet technologies. Though, its grasp on development tools and investing on day today product as Office and SharePoint will allow it to move on. \n\nNevertheless, it has to open fighting fronts with emerging companies through fostering its msn/social media platform. As new companies Facebook, twitter, Google are creating colonies of people who adopt them and stay with them now they want these people to be able to do everything within their realms. They don’t want to share those colonies. It is better if these people don`t need anything from outside. As now for Mac people they don’t want to use PC as they are confortable in their world. If in Facebook you can do all work, relations, internet, search, you don’t need the Office software or the use of twitter. So there is this paradigm of keeping the colonies and sharing this market. Microsoft will continue as there are smart people within the company but if the company is lucky to have a new leader with new vision and high knowledge of technology and business the company will move from being cash cow moving towards retirement to a new leader in technology. One thing that Microsoft should think about is its own people as I have been in company owned by Microsoft. \n\nMicrosoft thinks it is too strong and highly praised so that it could afford the status of slave owner as the Roman Empire had been one upon the time. Employees who work 80 hours per week and have no family life just to hold the title of Microsoft employee, Lot of people are stepping out because of this politic that the company has, the company wants everybody to burn, what matters is that the pyramid looks high. My be ozzi had all what he wanted, but at the end he discovered, that he was just big slave with more money and no life, if the company want to make the life of the people in this world better it should look at its politics with its own people. It has a politic similar to the old state of Sparta unfortunately Sparta vanished even if it had the best soldiers in the world it reached the level where there was no human aspect to the life of its citizens, they were just killing machines so they were easily beaten by weaker human people (Macedonian tribes for historical knowledge). If the company has smart people as it claims these people should think about the within of the company everything after that will be good. \n\nThanks Mr. Vincent for such an interesting Article"
