content: Office 365 is great effort of integration of multiple Microsoft products in order to give social media flavour that seamlessly endorses the office environment. Something that I wanted to mention is that office 365 is bringing new infrastructure architecture and new key positions in the IT world. I see it as new technology that will change the dynamics of the warfare and hence the tactics and composition of the workforce. Office 365 is integrating and hence centralizing the management of many products this requires the creation of  Microsoft System Center administrator a new type of position just like radio operator was introduced to military once upon the time. Centralization will require creative architecture that allows full integration while preserving autonomy, flexibility and adaptability.
