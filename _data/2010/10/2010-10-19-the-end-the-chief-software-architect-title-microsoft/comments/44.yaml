  And thank you for the historical analogy, very interesting!


  Apparently Microsoft isn't the crazy hours slayer it used to be.  People on Channel 9 seems to be very enthusiasts to work there.  But...  I don't know.  It doesn't have the startup appeal Google had 5 years ago for young people either.


  As Mary-Jo Foley mentionned in her "Microsoft 2.0" book (http://www.amazon.ca/Microsoft-2-0-Plans-Relevant-Post-Gates/dp/0470191384/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287519690&amp;sr=8-5), the high management is all over 50 (starting with Balmer).  They definitely missed the web 2.0 wave.  Mind you, they missed the web 1.0 wave as well and didn't recover too badly for it ;)


  I think you're right about the web 2.0 war being about capturing audiences.  Those audiences are quite volatile when you compare them to a software user base though (e.g. Windows, Office).  Microsoft is extremely strong in platforming:  establishing a standard (even if there's already one in place) where third party can plug-in.  But this new web 2.0 is very tribal and doesn't care too much about standards.  We've seen it with the iPhone and now the iPad:  there is a lot of software writen for those platforms only.  The cool factor won it all!
