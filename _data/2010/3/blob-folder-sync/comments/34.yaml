  Hi,



  That might actually be a good extension.  I would need to tiddy up the code since it's currently branched out into a refactoring branch and not %100 completed.


  What type of scenarios would that address?  Syncing two SP document lists?  Syncing a share folder and a SP list?  Syncing a SP List with "personnal folders"?
