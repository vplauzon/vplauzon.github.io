  Vincent, I`m fine with performing Automation.

  However, not clear yet with the Azure VM Scale set features.

  a) If I set Windows based VM Scaleset with custom application installed on the first instance.

  Will the next VM will have the VM with the custom app on it?

  (we are not using Containers, as quite small firm to think of investing in that area)

  b) If yes, so do I still need availability server (to take care from Update and Fault domain) or its a default feature of VM scale set?


  Thanks in advance for your assistance.


  Jason
