content: Thanks very much for sharing your findings and knowledge.  I had to spend some time finding some of the basic features of EF 4.1 as the 'Getting started' guides do not cover other aspects apart from creating a simple web app using the default behavior. You have certainly saved some of my time finding other stuff I didn't know. Thanks again!
