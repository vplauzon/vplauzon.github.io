  Hi,



  Well...  I don't know exactly what is inside your custom methods (GetArticleByID, DeleteComment, Save, etc.), but I'll assume they do what their names imply and not more.


  The only thing I could see from the distance is that you load a comment directly and delete it in 'DeleteComment' which might bypass the ORM tracking system so that when you try to delete the article, it might try to cascade the delete on the comments that are no longer in the Database.


  That would be my best guess by not looking at the code.  I haven't tested cascade delete but I wouldn't be surprise if it is implemented, hence you could probably skip the entire foreach loop and your code could work...  I believe ;)
