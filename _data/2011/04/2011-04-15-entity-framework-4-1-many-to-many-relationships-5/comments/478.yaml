content: Relation table (e.g. EmployeeOrder) can only contain primary keys from their related tables in order to be represented 'implicitely' in the object model.  If we want more fields / columns, we need to represent them explicitely, e.g. as an EmployeeOrder object having two properties, Employee &amp; Order (then Employee &amp; Order objects could have a collection of Employee Orders) and the others (e.g. Count in your example).
