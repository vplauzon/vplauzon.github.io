  Just a quick question about how you define a task service in this taxonomy, as I'm having similar debates about what constitutes a task.  Could a task service be a small "action", ie an operation that doesn't require composition?  So if I have a requirement to allow customers to update their personal info, like address, would I have a task service named ChangeCustomerMailingAddress, that in turn calls the update operation on the Customer entity?  Or would it be better to call the entity service directly?  Another example would be retrieving data, like RetrieveCustomerBillingHistory, would that be a separate task service, or just an operation on the Customer entity service?


  Any insight is appreciated.

  Thanks
