  Typically you won't be able to directly bind your model to a view in that case.  You'll probably want to have something where you show an instance of type A (in a many-to-many relationship with type B) and a list of instances of type B and you let the user 'add' B-instances into A.


  In the model you then simply add B instances in the virtual list property of A.
