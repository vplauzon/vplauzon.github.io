  True I did not cover querying for that specific topic.  For your specific example, it's pretty simple (for a given employee id):


  var orders = from e in context.Employees
     where e.EmployeeID==theEmployeeID
     select e.Orders;

  or if you already have a reference to an employee 'e':


  e.Orders



  Is that what you meant?


  We could do something more complicated, for instance:


  var names = from o in context.Orders
     from e in o.InvolvedEmployees
     where o.OrderID == 2
     select e.EmployeeName;

  This would fetch, for the orderID '2' all the employee names related to it.


  Basically, as usual with EF, you can walk up and down relationships.
