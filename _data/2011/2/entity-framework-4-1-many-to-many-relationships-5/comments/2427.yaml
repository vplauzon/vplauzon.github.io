  Mu question is how to Bind a Combo Box so that it retrieves and display content corresponding to the Id in a link table and populates itself with the data in the main table?


  I am developing a desktop application in Wpf using MVVM and Entity Frameworks. I have the following tables:


  1. Party (PartyId, Name)


  2. Case (CaseId, CaseNo)


  3. Petitioner (CaseId, PartyId) ............. Link Table


  I am completely new to .Net and to begin with I downloaded Microsoft's sample application (Employee Tracker)  and following the pattern I have been successful in replicating it for my specific use. The problem started when I wanted to implement many-to-many relationship. The sample application has not covered the scenario where there can be a many-to-many relationship. However with the help of MSDN forum I came to know about a link table and managed to solve entity framework issues pertaining to many-to-many relationship.


  In my application when I select a Case Number in the Grid, the details corresponding to the selected case are displayed in the user control on the right. Further, depending upon the number of records in the Petitioner (the link table) the corresponding viewmodel loads that much numbers of the ComboBoxes where I want Name of petitioner stored in the Party table to be displayed as selected Item. I also want these ComboBox/es to be populated with the names stored in the Party table. Despite Viewmodel loads correct numbers of ComboBoxes, the ComboBoxes neither display name of the associated Petitioners nor they get populated with the Party name.


  Please help.
