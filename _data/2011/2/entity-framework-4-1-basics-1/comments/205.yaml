content: I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to write this and the other EF 4.1 code first entries. I agree with you 100%...it is hard to find documentation regarding the Code first approach that is not CTP related. I have been struggling for a few days now with seemingly simple scenarios and constantly coming up short. Your articles have been a great help to me   while I have worked to try and wrap my head around the "Black Box" called EF. Thanks again and keep up the great work!
