  Indeed, I believe the SDK used in the code base taps into an obsolete version of the API, hence the incompatibility.


  That tool has been superseded with the Azure Portal abilities, i.e. it now does everything that tool was doing.  I would suggest using the Portal from now on.


  Unless you have a scenario where the tool would make more sense than the portal?
