  Hi,


  What would be involved in updating it to the new API, The azure portal query experience is a bit limited with window size and it not being that adjustable, and only really scales well in 1080p, when i'm working on my little laptop, doing queries is a right pain as the screen resolution isn't there. Doing SQL based queries in this tool was a nice experience. Are there no plans to update it?
