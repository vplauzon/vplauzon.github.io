  I was doing a case insensitive join on strings, e.g.:


  var result = new[] { "a" }.FullOuterJoin(new[] { "A" }, n =&gt; n, n =&gt; n, (a, b) =&gt; Tuple.Create(a, b), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase).Single();

  Console.WriteLine("Item 1: " + (result.Item1 ?? "(null)"));

  Console.WriteLine("Item 2: " + (result.Item2 ?? "(null)"));


  Hope that looks okay - I had problems posting the greater than symbols.
