  Yes, that is perfectly normal.  Both AzCopy &amp; Storage Explorer are based on the same library (https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net-data-movement).


  The reasons to use AzCopy :


  <ol>

  <li>You are in an environment without UI</li>

  <li>You want to automate data movement</li>

  <li>You want to move data from one cloud source to a cloud destination and do not want to transit the data on your PC / network (related to 1)</li>

  </ol>
