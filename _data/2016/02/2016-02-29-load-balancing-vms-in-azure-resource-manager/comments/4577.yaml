  They share the same Storage Account but not the same vhd file.  So no to your last question.  Actually, Azure doesn't support having VMs sharing the same VHD.  VHDs are attached to one and only one VM at the time.


  The only way to "share a disk" is to use File Storage and using its SMB endpoint to mount a share on both VMs.
