  hello, I am not a developer so apologies but I'm not familiar at all with Visual Studio. when I add "AntiForgeryConfig.UniqueClaimTypeIdentifier = ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier;" I have a red line and it says that "'claimtypes' does not exist in the current contex". Do I have to install anything on top of VS?

  Thanks!
