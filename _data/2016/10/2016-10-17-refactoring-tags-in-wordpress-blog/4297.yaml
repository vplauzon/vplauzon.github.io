content: Heya Vincent, might be worth keeping an eye out on the Bingle Webmasters tools' search consoles. A lot of refactors here might cause a lot of broken links in the wild. I use yoast SEO Premium, which makes it easy to set up all the redirects, but of course you can do it manually, or programmatically yourself.
