  Vincent,

  First of all nice article that touches to most of the bits I`m searching with pulling my hair to get answers.


  Few questions:

  I`m using Stateless VM (2 VM in HA) at one Azure Datacenter. If the VM goes down then DR environment to be built using CHEF or Puppet.

  Database: Azure SQL Database


  In such a case, can you help me understand:

  a) what sought of Azure Storage do I need  (RA-GRS or GRS)?

  b) what should be Azure Backup (LRS or GRS)?


  Any information will be valuable to head further.
