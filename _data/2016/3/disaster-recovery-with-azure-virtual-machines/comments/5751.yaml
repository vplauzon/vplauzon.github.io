  So I dont need ASR service, as using CHEF I can sping up VM in DR site as and when required.

  In response to your comment - "Just make sure that CHEF and all the scripts you need are available in your failover region though."

  In order to have failover region, I guess need to store the CHEF related data on Storage Account (Files) and have GRS so the data is available in the other datacenter part of the same region.

  If yes, any article that describes the same more in detail.
