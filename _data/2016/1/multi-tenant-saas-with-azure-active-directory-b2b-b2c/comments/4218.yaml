  Hi PÃ¥l,


  That is a good point!


  The scenario I had in mind was "a few customers".  The basis of that article was a customer need and they run a SaaS and target less than 20 customers over time (in the next few years).


  For somebody running a SaaS with customers onboarding weekly or daily, that approach would quickly become unmanageable and then I would recommend one of the other approaches touched on the article.
