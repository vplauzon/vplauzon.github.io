  Hum...  you could open the communication port to the public internet traffic (or even limit it by IP range) I suppose.  This way you could connect from your tool on your desktop to it.


  The other option, as I believe you mention, is to lock it down for public traffic and use a VPN Gateway to privately connect to the VNet.
