  You would need to use a where-clause and check the content of the resource group (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object?view=powershell-6).


  That will likely be slow since you'll need to check the number of resources (API call) for each resource group.


  Alternatively, you can list all resources (with their resource group) and grab only the resource group name.  Then compare that with the list of resource groups.  You should find the ones that weren't attached to any resources.
