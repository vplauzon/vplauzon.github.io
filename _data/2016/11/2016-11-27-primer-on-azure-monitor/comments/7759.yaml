  Azure Monitor &amp; Azure Log Analytics are logging solutions.  Azure Security Center pushes the envelop a little further.


  None of those have the pretention to replace a SIEM.  A SIEM will offer you features such as event correlation which you can't fully and flexibly implement with those native solution.


  It is unfortunate but that is the state of Native Security Solutions right now.


  Now, if what you need is a subset of SIEM features, it is quite possible that a native Azure solution can fulfill that subset.  For instance, if what you need for your compliance is to log access and keep those logs for X months, then, yes, you might be in business.



  I've seen customer doing a lot of scenarios.  Some just use Log Analytics with fancy custom dashboards.  Some use Log Analytics as a staging environments for logs and feed a SIEM with either raw logs or Log Analytics queries (whatever query you can do in the UI you can also do in REST API) to get transformed / aggregated data.  Some customers feed their on-prem SIEM, others install a SIEM in Azure.  It all depends on the volume of data they are processing &amp; the licensing scheme of their SIEM product.




  Maybe not the straight answer you were looking for, but I hope that helps.
