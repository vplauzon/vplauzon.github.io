  Hi Pradeep,


  I would say that passing the credentials to a middleware isn't a good security practice.


  What I guess you are trying to do is to have your middleware behave "on behalf" of your end-user.  For this, please look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow.


  I wrote an article a while ago to login to AAD using credentials (see https://vincentlauzon.com/2017/01/29/authenticating-to-azure-ad-non-interactively/) but given the feedback I received in the last couple of months, it doesn't seem to work anymore.


  I would recommend you either do an "on behalf" or use the trusted sub system pattern (see http://soapatterns.org/design_patterns/trusted_subsystem).  That is, have a service principal in your middleware access the back-end resources.
