content: I was also re-thinking our strategy for a multi-tenant SaaS solution with this multi-ADs approach.  I wasn't thinking about the issue of provisioning ADs automatically, but I was starting to wonder how to know what AD to use at the time of user-login.  The user would have to choose the tenant pre-login (or otherwise navigate to different pages, etc).
