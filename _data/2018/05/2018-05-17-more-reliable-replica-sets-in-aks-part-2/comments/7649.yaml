  Hi Danilo,



  No I haven't tried integrating an AKS cluster into an existing VNET if that is what you meant.


  I plan to move a couple of tiny web site "tools" I'm using from Azure App Services to AKS in order to experiment more DevOps scenarios.  But I didn't have the need to integrate with an existing VNET yet.


  Have you tried it?
