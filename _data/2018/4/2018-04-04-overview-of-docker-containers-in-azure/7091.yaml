  I didn't go into "why Docker" here.  Typically, containers are used to achieve greater density than VMs, i.e. you can pack more containers than VMs on the same hardware.  Also containers, with orchestrators enable more agile architectures such as Micro Services.  It's quite easy to add / remove / upgrade containers on the fly compare to managing VMs.


  As for "real time" challenges...  I'm not sure I understand your question.
