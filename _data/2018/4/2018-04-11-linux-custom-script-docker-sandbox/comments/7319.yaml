content: '[&#8230;] It is quite easy and convenient to do this demo on our laptop.  Same thing for any training (e.g. those suggested in the previous section) .  It requires a Linux environment.  We use Windows Subsystem for Linux (aka bash shell).  If for some reason that isn’t possible, we can always provision a VM in Azure with Azure CLI.
