content: "You made a bit of a mistake in your math at the end! 10^284 years isn't 28 times longer than the current universe at 1.3x10^10. Each exponent is 10x the years. So 10^(284-10) is the actually number of universe ages it would take to process 1000 qubits classically. So it would take 10^274 universe ages to process that same info. Not 28. "
