  ARM Template can always be used on existing resources.  They can be used to create and update.  In your case though, you want to create a new resource, i.e. a role assignment.  It's just that that resource is related to an existing resource.


  So yes, definitely possible.  I never tried to have a resource in a resource group and an assignment in a different group.  It might or might not be supported.


  What you can do though is to deploy something in that group.  ARM Template now supports deploying resources in a different resource group (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-cross-resource-group-deployment).
