  First of all, great post and very nice presentation of a point where many would profit from.


  One small remark  on the documentation side:


  The Application ID is clear, this is the one in the portal, however the Object ID in the portal is the Object ID of the application not the Object ID of the service principal.


  For the ARM Template to work we will need the SP ID.


  Using PowerShell: Get-AzureRMADServicePrincipal -SearchString "AppName"


  To get the Application ID: Get-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayNameStartWith "AppName"


  Again great work, many thanks!
