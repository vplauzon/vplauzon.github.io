content: "Per MS: Azure Networking has no visibility into the service IP range of the Kubernetes cluster. Because of the lack of visibility into the cluster's service address range, it's possible to later create a new subnet in the cluster virtual network that overlaps with the service address range. If such an overlap occurs, Kubernetes could assign a service an IP that's already in use by another resource in the subnet, causing unpredictable behavior or failures. By ensuring you use an address range outside the cluster's virtual network, you can avoid this overlap risk."
