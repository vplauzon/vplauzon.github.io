  A SP is an application.  An application isn't necessary a sp.  A sp can authenticate while applications are authenticated against (see https://vincentlauzon.com/2016/03/10/azure-active-directory-application/).


  SP could be a completely separate concept to application.  They have more in common with users than applications.
