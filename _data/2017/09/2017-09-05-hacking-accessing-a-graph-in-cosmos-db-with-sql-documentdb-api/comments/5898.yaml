  So, if the Graph is actually stored (and queries / written) as JSONs which would be the difference between selecting Graph or SQL when creating a new Cosmo instance (the API setting)? Is there any under the hood process that relies on this? (maybe some indexing...).


  As far as I can tell from the docs you can select SQL and read/write via Gremlin and select Graph and read/write like with any other DocumentDB. Am I missing something?
