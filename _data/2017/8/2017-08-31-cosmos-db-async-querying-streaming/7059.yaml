  Totally!


  In the sample I gave I went the "let's load everything" route.  A more RAM conscious route would be to yield as you go.  I did do that in some private (i.e. I didn't blog about it) implementation and it works well.  I basically defined an "IAsyncEnumerable" interface, which I found has been missing in .NET since we introduced async.


  I believe there is such an async-enumerable coming in an upcoming version of the Fx so it will be a nice opportunity to have a standard to build upon instead of my "Vincent-Async-Enumerable".


  The advantage by doing so is RAM as you rightfully pointed out.  Also you can stop going through the list if you found what you were looking for...
