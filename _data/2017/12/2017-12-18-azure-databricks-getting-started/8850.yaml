  As there are no official PowerShell cmdlets for the Databricks REST API (and probably will never be according to my information), I created a module and uploaded it to the PowerShell gallery

  https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DatabricksPS


  The cmdlets work with Databricks on Azure and also Databricks on AWS


  I also blogged about it here:
