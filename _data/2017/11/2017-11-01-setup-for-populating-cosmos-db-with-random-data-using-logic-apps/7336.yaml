  I don't think the Cosmos DB connector expose any management capabilities.  You would need to use the Management API.  More likely you could implement a PowerShell script doing that in Azure Automation and expose the runbook as a webhook which you could invoke from Logic App.


  Alternatively, if time is no issue, you can simply pump the documents in Event Hub and then use Stream Analytics to direct the documents to Cosmos DB.  Stream Analytics will take care of backing off if Cosmos DB with low RU can't ingest the documents.
