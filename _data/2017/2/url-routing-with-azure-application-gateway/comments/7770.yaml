  Yes definitely! It gets a little confusing because in the GUI Resource manager it is called "Override Backend Path" but in the template you are referencing it is just called "path" as part of the BackendHttpSettings object. It's located at


  backendHttpSettingsCollection:properties:path


  However, I'd like to point out about it is that when overriding the backend path. I thought I could use it like "mydomain.com/a" without the trailing "/" but currently to get the request to be routed properly you have to have the trailing "/" like "mydomain.com/a/" or it won't go through.
