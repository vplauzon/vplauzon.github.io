  Hi ,your post is very interesting, I already did all the steps, I actually get a token but I do not understand when I use the microsoft graph api to upload a file is not working, in the AuthContext I only see that it gets the token, but not the user information or one account when save the file.


  also create a console application and a web aplication and two Azure Aplications With respect to the previous article but i think this applications dont work together.
