  Hi Carlos,


  Yes you're right:  since this article was published the actual bandwidth is published.


  I believe the bandwidth is shared across NICs.  So if you have one NIC, you can reach the bandwidth.  The NICs are virtual.


  IOPs is a different story.  It's a different 'channel', i.e. if you use a lot of network bandwidth you do not impact the IOPs of your disks &amp; vis versa.
