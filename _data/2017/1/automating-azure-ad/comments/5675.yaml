  Hi Mavi,



  AAD tenants do not belong to subscriptions like other Azure resources.  So they aren't limited to a subscription (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).  If that helps...


  Otherwise, the way to that would be to bring the users in a tenant, using AAD B2B (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).


  But in general, ask yourself why you have two tenants.  It usually result in a mess.  User identity is key within an application and you shouldn't spread it around multiple tenants unless they are from different organisations, in which case you can integrate with B2B.
