  You can have a look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview for ASR.  They mention the RPO could be as low as replications every 30 seconds.


  Basically ASR replicates on a continuous basis.  An agent in the VM intercept every IO calls and feed it to replication.


  RTO would basically be the time it takes your ops team to acknowledge a service outage in the primary region + the time to failover.  Failover time is linked to the time to create disks from replication vault &amp; boot the VMs.  I would definitely test it to get a number.


  Have a look at https://vincentlauzon.com/2016/07/11/disaster-recovery-with-azure-virtual-machines/ to see different options you have for DR in Azure.
