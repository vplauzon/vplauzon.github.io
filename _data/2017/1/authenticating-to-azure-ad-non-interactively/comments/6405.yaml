  I do not know.  My guess is there are three avenues:


  1- that API took a different shape in the .NET core SDK

  2- that API isn't supported (yet?) in .NET core SDK

  3- that API is deprecated and isn't supported in new SDKs


  If option 1 doesn't pan out, i.e. you can't find anything in the SDK, you could try to do it in .NET fx, capture the HTTP POST generated by the SDK and simply write custom HTTP-request code in .NET Core to handle the authentication.  The issue you'll then have is how to insert the token you got so you can continue the flow with ADAL...


  Have you tried hitting the developer forums with this question?  It would be interesting to get an answer from the product owners.
