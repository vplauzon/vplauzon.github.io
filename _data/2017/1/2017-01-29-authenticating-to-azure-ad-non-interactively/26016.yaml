  It has been awhile since I fixed this and I made a ton of changes since then. I made a modification to the Microsoft github project for embedded powerbi. Here's the URL to that project: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples. It took me awhile to understand all the processes involved in generating, obtaining, and passing the token. But ultimately I had to use the following approach.


  var authenticationResult = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(serviceUri, clientID, credential)
