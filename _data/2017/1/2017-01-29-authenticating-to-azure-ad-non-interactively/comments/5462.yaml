  Hello Vincent,

  The code calls I understand. But from where did the assigned values come from, for the variables: tenant , serviceUri , clientID?

  I know what TenantId is, and what ApplicationId is (in this Azure AD context).  But 'tenant' is not TenantId, and I do not know that 'clientID' is?

  For 'serviceUri', I expect to use http://manager.azure.com/ , does that seem sane?


  Thanks for the C# code example, by the way.
