  Hi Vincent,

  I am trying to replace LDAP in a web application. Created the client as "public client" app and created service app as "web". No more i see "WebApp /API" and "Native". Instead listed as "Web" and "public client". But not sure what to give for "APP ID URI" for the service app. is that the web application login URL?
