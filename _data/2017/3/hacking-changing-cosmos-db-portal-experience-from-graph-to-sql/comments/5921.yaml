  Would you happen to know if there is there an official public documentation of any sort detailing this?


  I've asked the same question about the role of the API switchin this context to the CosmosDB support guys (askcosmosdb@microsoft.com / askcosmosdbgraphapi@microsoft.com) and got basically the same vague eplination that the msdn docs give.
