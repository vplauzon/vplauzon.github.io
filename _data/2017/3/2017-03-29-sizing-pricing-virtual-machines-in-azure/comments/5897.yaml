content: "nice articles, I was seeing they specify the max bandwitch o network perfomance that can be reached for some SKU Types (Max NICs / Expected network performance (Mbps))\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general#dsv2-series \n\nso only one NIC can reach those bandwidths? just to be sure or I have to do some nic teaming to achieve 3000 Mbps like the example you depicted above to achieve 20000 IOPS to stripe several disks\n\nthanks"
