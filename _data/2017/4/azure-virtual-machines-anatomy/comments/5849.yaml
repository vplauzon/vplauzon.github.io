  Hi Marian.


  No that isn't accurate.  You made me doubt myself, so I tested it and it can't be done.


  I assumed it was possible because you can build the NICs separately in two different VNET.  But one you join them to a VM, there's a validation failing with the explicit error message:


  "Subnet Subnet referenced by resource _X_ is not in the same Virtual _Y_ as the subnets of other VMs in the availability set."


  I updated the blog, see UPDATE (26-10-2017).


  Thanks for your input Marian!
