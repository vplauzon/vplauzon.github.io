  Hi Deva,



  Hum...  not sure.  In theory it's a portable Library, so it should.  I'm really not steep on the Xamarin Platform, so the best way would be to test it.


  As I mentionned on the post, I targetted Windows 8+ &amp; .NET 4.5.1.  I might be able to target a larger base.


  Try it out and if it doesn't work, let's try to iron out the problems together.



  Cheers
