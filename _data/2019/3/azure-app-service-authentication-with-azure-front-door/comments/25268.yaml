  Hiya,


  Good solution as i hit the same issue with an Web App with Azure AD integration / EasyAuth . What about if you want to host on multiple web app instance (ie to load balance / redundancy)  , as you won't be able to register the custom domain on multiple Web App instances ?


  cheers

  Andy
