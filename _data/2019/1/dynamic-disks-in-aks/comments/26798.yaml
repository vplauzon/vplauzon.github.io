  Hello Vincent,


  Thanks for the response. Currently working yaml looks like the one you shared in the link.

  I would like to know how can i add 2 metadata in volumeclaimtemplate.


  i was trying something like below snippet, which throws "UPGRADE FAILED: YAML parse error on WCSV9/templates/search-app-master.yaml: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 136: found unexpected end of stream"


  volumeMounts:
    - name: index1
      mountPath: /opt/WebSphere/Liberty/usr/servers/default/logs/container
    - name: index2
       mountPath: /opt/WebSphere/Appserver/logs/container

  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: index1
        namespace: test
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        storageClassName: "index1"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 3Gi
    - metadata:
        name: index2
        namespace: test
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        storageClassName: "index2"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 3Gi

  Could you please help us resolve this error.


  Thanks in advance,

  Shilpa
