  Hello Team,


  we are deploying statefulset in AKS with dynamic PV on managed disk, for single mount scenario the sample given in volumclaimtemplate works without any issues, but when we need 2 mounts to be provisioned dynamically how do we use volumclaimtemplate ?


  could you please help us with a sample yaml with multiple metadata within volumeclaimtemplates.


  Regards

  Shilpa
