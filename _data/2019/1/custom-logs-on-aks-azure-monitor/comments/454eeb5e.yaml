  So Azure Monitor deploys a daemon (i.e. a pod per node) that will collect stdout stderr.  It *does not* collect any custom files.


  The sidecar approach suggested by K8s doc have a sidecar continuously reading custom files (in a shared folder) and outputting it in its own stdout.  This way, Azure Monitor can then catch those stdout.
