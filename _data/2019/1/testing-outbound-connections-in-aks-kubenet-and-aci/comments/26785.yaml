  Since the NSG let only private IPs coming from the AKS-subnet through and the request does go through, we're forced to conclude the oubound IP was from that AKS-subnet.


  So, although the packets travel around AKS with cluster IPs, they still seem to be stamped with the VMs IPs when they leave it.
