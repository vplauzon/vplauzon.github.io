  This sounds more like a ConfigMap (cf https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/) thing.


  If you need your entire appsettings.config to be secret...  yes, I suppose you could encrypt it all in KeyVault.  I didn't find any upper limit to the size of secret, so it would be worth a try.
