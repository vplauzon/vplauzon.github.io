  Yeah! configmap is the first way we've tried. Some cases, application config contains lots of "secrets" within, so.. we're evaluating to include it as a whole secret to avoid lots of secrets replacements.

  The size limit for a secret is 25Kb, so.. in most cases it should fit.

  Not sure if it's the best way to proceed, but it's a way :)
