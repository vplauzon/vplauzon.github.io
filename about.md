I am Vincent-Philippe Lauzon.  I am based in Montreal with my lovely familly.  In my free time I do calisthenics & jogging.

I help customers accelerate their journey to Azure and decrease risks on their projects as one of Microsoft Canada's *Cloud Solution Architect*.

I studied in Mathematics-Physics before graduating in Machine Learning.  I spent most of my career consulting as a Solution Architect for more than 20 years.
