I am Vincent-Philippe Lauzon.  I am based in Montreal with my lovely familly.  In my free time I do calisthenics & jogging.

I work with different customers in the region to help them accelerate their journey to Azure and decrease the risks on their project as Microsoft Canada's *Cloud Solution Architect*.

I studied in Mathematics-Physics before graduating in Machine Learning.  I then spent most of my career as a consultant in different Information Technology contexts for more than 20 years.
